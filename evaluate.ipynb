    "An instruction (might include an input inside it), a response to evaluate, a reference answer that gets a score of 5, and a score rubric representing multiple evaluation criteria are given.\n",
    "1. Write detailed feedback that assesses the quality of the response strictly based on the given score rubrics below. Additional information is not a disadvantage unless it negatively impacts clarity or relevance.\n",
    "2. After writing feedback, provide a score that is an integer between 1 and 5 for each evaluation criterion.\n",
    "3. After writing the scores, provide an overall correctness score (Correct or Incorrect) if the response, in the context of a yes/no question, is correct.\n",
    "4. The output format should look as follows: \"Feedback: {{write feedback for each criterion}} [SCORE_FACTUALITY] {{score for factuality}} [SCORE_RELEVANCE] {{score for relevance}} [SCORE_COMPLETENESS] {{score for completeness}} [SCORE_CLARITY] {{score for clarity}} [SCORE_CONFIDENCE] {{score for confidence}} [CORRECTNESS] {{Correct or Incorrect}}\"\n",
