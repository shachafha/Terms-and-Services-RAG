### TERMS

#### 1\. Overview

**1.1.** These terms cover your access and use of Uber’s mobile applications and/or websites (the “**Terms**”). You must read carefully and agree to the Terms prior to accessing and using Uber’s mobile applications and/or websites. Your agreement to these Terms establishes a contractual relationship between you and Uber. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use Uber’s mobile applications and/or websites. These Terms expressly supersede prior agreements or arrangements about the App(s)/Websites Services (as defined below) between you and Uber.

**1.2.** These Terms apply to the extent they do not conflict with any user and supplemental terms that specifically apply to Uber's mobile applications and/or websites. You will be asked to agree to any such terms separately.

**1.3.** Uber acts as the agent for the Third Party Providers for Third Party Services and as the service provider for Uber Provided Services (see clause 4 below).

#### 2\. The App(s)/Website(s) Services

**2.1.** The services provided to you by Uber consist of:

**2.1.1.** Access to and use of Uber's mobile applications and/or websites which enable you to request and receive Third Party Services and/or Uber Provided Services; and

**2.1.2.** Payment collection and payment processing services (including issuing invoices and receipts on behalf of Third Party Providers) allowing us to charge you and to pay charges into the bank account of Third Party Providers for Third Party Services or Uber for Uber Provided Services (Uber B.V. may engage affiliates or third parties to provide these services on its behalf) (together the "**App/Website Services**").

**2.2.** These Terms apply to your use of the App(s)/Website(s) Services in Ireland. By accessing and using the App(s)/Website(s) Services in another country, you may be subject to country-specific terms. You can locate those terms by navigating to this [page](https://www.uber.com/legal/en/document/?name=general-terms-of-use&country=united-states&lang=en) and choosing the country from which you wish to access the Apps(s)/Website(s) Services.

**2.3.** Uber's mobile applications and/or websites will be made available to you under various Uber Brands.

**2.4.** Unless otherwise agreed separately in writing, the App(s)/Website(s) Services are made available to you for your personal non-commercial use only.

**2.5.** Where available, you can request and receive Third Party Services or Uber Provided Services via Uber’s mobile applications and/or websites.

#### 3\. Third Party Services

**3.1.** For Third Party Services, Uber acts as a disclosed agent between you and the Third Party Providers to enable them to provide the Third Party Services to you. Uber does not provide the Third Party Services. All Third Party Providers are independent third party contractors, registered businesses or other legal entities who are not employed by Uber.

**3.2.** When you are logged in, online and in the vicinity of Third Party Providers who are also logged in Uber’s mobile applications and/or websites, you will be given information in Uber’s mobile applications and/or websites about the Third Party Services before you decide to make a request.

**3.3.** Third Party Providers (for Third Party Services) and Uber (for Uber Provided Services) are free to decide to accept or reject a request. Acceptance of the request is communicated to you through Uber’s mobile applications and/or websites and will give rise to a direct contract between you and the Third Party Provider(s) (for Third Party Services) and/or between you and Uber (for Uber Provided Services).

**3.4.** For some Third Party Services, you may be required to agree to separate terms prior to using such Third Party Service(s).

**3.5.** You may be asked to rate the Third Party Provider whose services you requested. The Third Party Provider may also be able to give you a rating. Third Party Providers will see the rating in the Uber’s applications and/or websites and this rating may affect whether or not they decide to provide Third Party Services to you. For more information about ratings please consult our [Community Guidelines](https://www.uber.com/legal/en/document/?country=france&lang=en&name=general-community-guidelines).

**3.6.** The Third Party Provider is responsible for any obligations that may arise from the provision of the Third Party Services.

#### 4\. Uber Provided Services

**4.1.** For Uber Provided Services, Uber will act as the service provider. The specific terms governing Uber Provided Services will be set out in additional terms or a separate agreement.

**4.2.** When you use the mobile applications and/or websites that we make available to you under the various Uber Brands, we will make recommendations to you for certain Uber Provided Services or Third Party Services (together, App(s)/Website(s) Services) that we think are relevant and meaningful to you. Those recommendations may include recommendations for stores (e.g. restaurants), goods (e.g. groceries) or transportation options (e.g. Uber Taxi, Uber Black etc.). There are a number of factors that inform the recommendations that you see, but the most important factors are:

**4.2.1. Uber Eats:**

**Previous purchases and search history:** Recommendations take into account orders you have made in the past, and any interests we infer from those (e.g. cuisines or restaurants). If you have no or limited purchase history, recommendations may, instead, consist of stores or goods that are generally popular. You may also receive recommendations for stores or goods that you have not purchased but that you have shown an interest in, such as through previous searches or clicks.

**Location**: The address you provide (for delivered orders) or your current location (for pick-up orders) helps us to make recommendations to you for stores or goods that are closer to you, to minimise your overall wait time.

**Previous experience:** Feedback you have provided on previous orders, such as reviews and/or ratings, factor into the recommendation you see. For example, if you leave positive feedback about an order, we are more likely to recommend that store to you again in the future.

**Contextual factors:** Recommendations are informed by contextual factors, such as the time of day and the day of the week, as these are likely to impact the relevance of stores or goods to you. For example, restaurants that serve breakfast are more likely to be recommended to you at the start of the day.

**4.2.2. Uber:** 

**Previous purchases:** Your most used transportation option, or transportation options within a similar price range to your most used transportation option, are more likely to be recommended to you on future trips. If you have no or limited purchase history, recommendations may, instead, consist of transportation options that are generally popular.

**Location**: Your location helps us to recommend transportation options that are closest to you, based on available supply, at the time of your trip request. For example, if most of the available transportation options near your requested pick-up location are Uber Black, we are more likely to recommend Uber Black to you, above other transportation options.

**Contextual factors:** Recommendations are informed by contextual factors, as these are likely to impact the relevance of transportation options to you. These include:

**a. Day and time of your request**: In combination with location (described above), the day and time of your request is used to recommend transportation options that, based on availability, are closest to you at the time of your request.

**b. Estimated time of arrival (ETA):** Transportation options with the lowest ETA, relative to your requested drop-off location, are more likely to be recommended to you than transportation options with longer ETAs.

#### 5\. Using the App(s)/Website(s) Services

**5.1.** Uber’s mobile applications and/or websites can be downloaded or accessed on most modern mobile devices with an internet connection and equipped with popular operating systems such as Android or iOS.

**5.2.** You are responsible for obtaining the network access necessary to use the App(s)/Website(s) Services and are responsible for any rates and fees from your mobile network provider, including from data consumption while using Uber’s mobile applications and/or websites.

To use the App(s)/Website(s) Services, Uber Provided Services or certain Third Party Services, you may need to provide at least one valid payment method (credit card, debit card or any other accepted payment method). You may need to provide additional information, such as your address, and documents before using certain Uber Provided Services or Third Party Services.

**5.5.** You are under no obligation to log in to, or use, Uber’s mobile applications and/or websites, and neither are the Third Party Providers. If you choose to stop using Uber’s mobile applications and/or websites you may do so without giving us any notice.

**5.6.** We may temporarily restrict your access to and use of the App(s)/Website(s) Services if there is a suspected breach of your obligations (see clause 6 below) or of these Terms, including where we receive a complaint in relation to fraud.
