How and Why We Share Your Information
-------------------------------------

At Temu, we care deeply about privacy. While Temu shares your personal information for the purposes of targeted advertising, which may be considered a “sale” under applicable privacy laws, Temu does not “sell” personal information in the traditional sense. We may share your personal information with the following parties for the purpose of providing you with better services, providing you with personalised advertising and marketing communications, protecting your rights, and/or complying with legal requirements:

Affiliates. For the purpose of order fulfilment, we may share your personal information related to order fulfilment, such as shipping address, contact information, with Whaleco Technology Limited 's subsidiaries and affiliates. Other unrelated personal information will not be shared. These subsidiaries and affiliates either follow the same practices described in this Privacy Policy or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Policy.

Service providers. Third parties that provide services on our behalf or help us operate the Service or our business (such as hosting, information technology, customer support, email delivery, order fulfilment and delivery, marketing and website analytics). We generally require these service providers to use personal information only as necessary to perform the services or comply with applicable legal obligations.

Payment processors. Any payment card information you use to make a purchase on the Service is collected and processed directly by our payment processors.

Advertising and analytics partners. Third-party advertising, marketing, and analytics companies for the interest-based advertising and analytics purposes described in our Cookie and Similar Technologies Policy. Certain of these disclosures to third parties are known as “sharing” or processing your personal information for targeted ads and but “sharing” may be considered “selling” your personal information under applicable law. For additional information and to learn about your right to opt out of such practices, see the

Your Rights and Choices

section, and the Cookie and Similar Technologies Policy.

Third parties designated by you. We may share your personal data with third parties where you have instructed us or provided your consent to do so. We may share the personal information required for the services you request with third parties designated by you.

Business and marketing partners. Specialist third parties with whom we may collaborate in order to offer or promote the Service.

Professional advisors, authorities, and regulators. We may share your information with our professional advisors (e.g. lawyers, auditors, bankers and insurers), in response to legal processes (such as those issued by courts or authorities in your country of residence); and with other parties in order to enforce our agreements or policies, protect the rights, property and safety of Temu, users and others, and to detect, prevent and address actual or suspected fraud, violations of Temu's Terms of Use, other illegal activities, security issues or when it's required by law.

Business transferees. Acquirers and other relevant participants in business transactions (or negotiations of or due diligence for such transactions) involving a corporate divestiture, merger, consolidation, acquisition, reorganisation, sale, or other disposition of all or any portion of the business or assets of, or equity interests in, Whaleco or our affiliates (including, in connection with a bankruptcy or similar proceedings).

The merchandise partner will not receive your payment information or your contact information.

Please note that, in using our Services, you may share personal information to others; for example, when other users view items on Temu, they may see item reviews you left. They will not see your profile photo and name if you hide your profile photo and name when leaving reviews.

Your Rights and Choices
-----------------------

If you are a Data Subject regarding the Processing activities described in this Privacy Policy, you may have the following rights and choices which can be exercised in accordance with applicable law:

Right to Know / Access. The right to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not Personal Data concerning you are being Processed, and, where that is the case, access to the Personal Data and certain information.

Right to Erasure. The right to request that we delete Personal Data we maintain about you without undue delay if and to the extent that the Personal Data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were processed, you have withdrawn your consent on which the processing is based and where there is no other legal ground for the processing. In addition, deletion will be conducted if you object to the processing and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, the Personal Data have been unlawfully processed, or the Personal Data have to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in the EU or Member State to which we are subject.

Right to Rectification. The right to request that we correct inaccurate Personal Data we maintain about you.

Right to Restriction of Processing. The right to request that we restrict the processing if you contest the accuracy of the Personal Data or if the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of the Personal Data and request the restriction of their use instead. Also, the processing will be restricted if we no longer need the Personal Data for the purposes of the processing, but you require it for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. We also restrict the processing if you have objected to processing pending the verification whether our legitimate grounds override yours.

Right to Data Portability. The right to request that we provide the Personal Data concerning you, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. Also, you have the right to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from us. This applies where the processing is based on consent or on a contract and the processing is carried out by automated means. Also, you have the right to have the personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible. Click here to submit a data request.

Right to Object. The right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to processing of Personal Data concerning you which is based on a task carried out in the public interest or on a legitimate interest. We will no longer process the Personal Data in case of such objection unless we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. When we process Personal Data for direct marketing purposes, including profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of your Personal Data. See section below on ‘Opt-out from Marketing Communications’ for further information.

Right to Withdraw Consent. The right to withdraw your consent at any time, where processing is based on your consent. The withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

Right to object to/opt-out of automated decision making: The right not to be subject to a decision when it is based on automated processing (i.e., an operation that is performed without any human intervention), if it produces a legal effect (i.e., impacts your legal rights) or significantly affects you in a similar way (e.g., significantly affects your financial circumstances or ability to access essential goods or services), or to opt out of the processing of your Personal Data for such purposes. Temu does not make decisions based solely on automated processing that produce a legal effect or similarly significantly affect individuals.

Right to Lodge a Complaint with a Supervisory Authority. Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, the right to lodge a complaint with our lead supervisory authority, the Irish Data Protection Commission or your local supervisory authority, if you consider that the processing of Personal Data relating to you infringes the GDPR.

These rights may be limited, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another person, where they would infringe the rights of a third party (including our rights) or if you ask us to erase information which we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping. Relevant exemptions are included in both the GDPR/UK GDPR and in relevant local implementing legislation.

You may exercise any of these rights by submitting a request via our web form dedicated to data subject requests or by contacting us using the information provided below. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of these rights. We may need to collect information from you to verify your identity, before providing a substantive response to the request. You may also designate an authorised agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will require that the agent provide proof you have authorised them to act on your behalf, and we may need you to verify your identity directly with us.

Opt-out from Marketing Communications. To manage your preferences or opt-out of marketing communications, you can take any of the following actions:

* Email Promotional Offers: If you do not want to receive emails from us regarding special promotions or offers, you may follow the unsubscribe options at the bottom of each email.

Our Global Operations and Data Transfers
----------------------------------------

To support our global operations:

* We store the information described in the “What Information Do We Collect?” section in servers located in the European Economic Area (EEA).
* Certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates, located outside the EU, EEA, UK and Switzerland, are given limited remote access to your personal data. See the “How and Why we Share your Information” section above for more information.
* We may share your information with service providers, partners and other parties described in the “How and Why We Share Your Information”, which can be located outside the EU, EEA, UK and Switzerland.

These parties commit to processing information in compliance with applicable privacy laws and to implementing appropriate security measures to protect your information.

When we transfer your information outside of the EU, EEA, UK and Switzerland, we ensure it benefits from an adequate level of data protection by relying on:

* Adequacy decisions. These are decisions from the European Commission under Article 45 GDPR (or equivalent decisions under other laws) where they recognise that a country offers an adequate level of data protection. We transfer your information as described in “What Information Do We Collect?” to some countries with adequacy decisions, such as the countries listed here; or
* Standard contractual clauses. The European Commission has approved contractual clauses under Article 46 of the GDPR that allows companies in the EEA to transfer data outside the EEA. These (and their approved equivalent for the UK and Switzerland) are called standard contractual clauses. We rely on standard contractual clauses to transfer information as described in “What Information Do We Collect?” to certain affiliates and third parties in countries without an adequacy decision.

In certain situations, we rely on derogations provided for under the applicable law to transfer information to a third country.

EU General Data Protection Regulation and UK Data Protection Laws – Legal Basis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The EU GDPR and UK data protection laws requires a legal basis for our use of personal information. Our basis varies depending on the specific purpose for which we use personal information. We use:

* Performance of a contract. when we provide our Services, or communicate with you about them. This includes when we use your personal information to develop, improve, support, and provide the Service, allowing you to use its features while fulfilling and enforcing our Terms of Use.
* Our legitimate business interests and the interests of third parties and/or our customers. when we optimize features, analyse performance metrics, fix errors, and improve the Service and our business, when we detect and prevent fraud and abuse in order to protect the security of our customers, ourselves, or others, and when we provide you with interest-based advertising.
* Your consent. when we ask for your consent to process your personal information for a specific purpose that we communicate to you. When you consent to our processing your personal information for a specified purpose, you may withdraw your consent at any time and we will stop processing of your data for that purpose.
* Compliance with a legal obligation. when we use your personal information for compliance purposes and to comply with the applicable law, laws, lawful requests, and legal processes (e.g. responding to subpoenas or requests from government authorities) associated with your country of residence; to protect our, yours, and other users' rights, privacy, safety, or property (including introducing and defending legal claims); audit internal processes to ensure compliance with legal and contractual requirements and our internal policies; enforce the terms and conditions that govern the Service; prevent, identify, investigate, and deter fraudulent, harmful, unauthorised, unethical, or illegal activities, including cyberattacks and identity theft.
* These and other legal bases depending on the purpose we described in the “How and Why We Use Your Information?”

Children
--------

The Service is not intended for use by anyone who is under the age of 18 or a minor (as defined by applicable law). If you are a parent or guardian of a child about whom you believe we have collected personal information, please contact us or through our online reporting form. If we learn that we have collected personal information through the Service from a child or without the knowledge of the child’s parent or guardian as required by law, we will comply with applicable legal requirements to delete the information.

Data Security and Retention
---------------------------

The security of your personal information is important to us. We use technical and administrative measures to help protect your personal information from loss, theft, misuse, unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration, and/or destruction. We also follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI-DSS”) in handling your credit card information. However, security risk is inherent in all internet and information technologies.

We generally retain personal information to fulfil the purposes for which we collected it, as well as for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, to establish or defend legal claims, or for fraud prevention purposes. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we may consider factors such as the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. When we no longer require the personal information we have collected about you, we may either delete it, or anonymise it.

Data of Temu users located in the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom (UK) and Switzerland will be stored by default in the infrastructure of cloud service providers in the European Economic Area (EEA). Temu is a global one-stop shopping destination, therefore where necessary, Temu may transfer data related to order fulfilment to service providers in other countries to provide order fulfilment and logistics services. Personal information (such as account and profile information) unrelated to fulfilment services will not be transferred. At the same time, in all cases, we will ensure that all transfers of personal data comply with applicable legal requirements.

If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by updating the date of this Privacy Policy, posting it on the Service and/or providing any notice required by applicable laws.
