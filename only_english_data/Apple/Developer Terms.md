##### 3.3.1 APIs and Functionality:

* **A. Documented APIs**
    
    Applications may only use Documented APIs in the manner prescribed by Apple and must not use or call any private APIs. Further, macOS Applications submitted to Apple for distribution on the App Store may use only Documented APIs included in the default installation of macOS, as bundled with Xcode and the Mac SDK, or as bundled with Swift Playgrounds; deprecated technologies (such as Java) may not be used.
    
* **B. Executable Code**
    
    Except as set forth in the next paragraph, an Application may not download or install executable code. Interpreted code may be downloaded to an Application but only so long as such code: (a) does not change the primary purpose of the Application by providing features or functionality that are inconsistent with the intended and advertised purpose of the Application as submitted to the App Store, (b) does not create a store or storefront for other code or applications, and (c) does not bypass signing, sandbox, or other security features of the OS.  
      
    An Application that is a programming environment intended for use in learning how to program may download and run executable code so long as the following requirements are met: (i) no more than 80 percent of the Application’s viewing area or screen may be taken over with executable code, except as otherwise permitted in the Documentation, (ii) the Application must present a reasonably conspicuous indicator to the user within the Application to indicate that the user is in a programming environment, (iii) the Application must not create a store or storefront for other code or applications, and (iv) the source code provided by the Application must be completely viewable and editable by the user (e.g., no pre-compiled libraries or frameworks may be included with the code downloaded).
    
* **C. Additional Features or Functionality**
    
    Without Apple’s prior written approval or as permitted under **Section 3.3.9(A) (In-App Purchase API)**, an Application may not provide, unlock or enable additional features or functionality through distribution mechanisms other than the App Store, Custom App Distribution or TestFlight.
    
* **D. Designated Container Areas, macOS Applications**
    
    An Application for iOS, watchOS, iPadOS, tvOS, or visionOS may only read data from or write data to an Application's designated container area on the device, except as otherwise specified by Apple. For macOS Applications submitted to Apple for distribution on the App Store: (a) all files necessary for the Application to execute on macOS must be in the Application bundle submitted to Apple and must be installed by the App Store; (b) all localizations must be in the same Application bundle and may not include a suite or collection of independent applications within a single Application bundle; (c) native user interface elements or behaviors of macOS (e.g., the system menu, window sizes, colors, etc.) may not be altered, modified or otherwise changed; (d) You may not use any digital rights management or other copy or access control mechanisms in such Applications without Apple’s written permission or as specified in the Documentation; and (e) except as otherwise permitted by **Section 3.3.9(A) (In-App Purchase API)**, such Applications may not function as a distribution mechanism for software and may not include features or functionality that create or enable a software store, distribution channel or other mechanism for software delivery within such Applications (e.g., an audio application may not include an audio filter plug-in store within the Application).
    
* **E. Compatibility Mode on iPadOS**
    
    An Application for iOS must have at least the same features and functionality when run by a user in compatibility mode on iPadOS (e.g., an iPhone app running in an equivalent iPhone-size window on an iPad must perform in substantially the same manner as when run on the iPhone; provided that this obligation will not apply to any feature or functionality that is not supported by a particular hardware device, such as a video recording feature on a device that does not have a camera). Further, You agree not to interfere or attempt to interfere with the operation of Your Application in compatibility mode.
    
* **F. Multitasking**
    
    You may use the Multitasking services only for their intended purposes as described in the Documentation.
    
* **G. Documentation**
    
    Applications must comply with the Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) and other Documentation provided by Apple. You agree to follow the HIG to develop an appropriate user interface and functionality for Your Application that is compatible with the design of Apple-branded products (e.g., a watchOS App should have a user interface designed for quick interactions in accordance with the HIG’s watchOS design themes).

You also represent and warrant that You will market Your Application only for its cleared or approved intended use/indication for use, and only in strict compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Upon Apple’s request, You agree to promptly provide any such clearance documentation to support the marketing of Your Application. If requested by the FDA or by another government body that has a need to review or test Your Application as part of its regulatory review process, You may provide Your Application to such entity for review purposes. You agree to promptly notify Apple in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 14.5 of any complaints or threats of complaints regarding Your Application in relation to any such regulatory requirements, in which case Apple may remove Your Application from distribution.

##### 3.3.3 Data and Privacy

* **A. Recordings**
    
    If Your Application captures or makes any video, microphone, screen recordings, or camera recordings, whether saved on the device or sent to a server (e.g., an image, photo, voice or speech capture, or other recording) (collectively “Recordings”), a reasonably conspicuous audio, visual or other indicator must be displayed to the user as part of the Application to indicate that a Recording is taking place.
    
    * In addition, any form of data, content or information collection, processing, maintenance, uploading, syncing, storage, transmission, sharing, disclosure or use performed by, through or in connection with Your Application must comply with all applicable privacy laws and regulations as well as any related Program Requirements, including but not limited to any notice or consent requirements.
* **B. Collection and Use of Data**
    
    You and Your Applications (and any third party with whom You have contracted to serve advertising) may not collect user or device data without prior user consent, whether such data is obtained directly from the user or through the use of the Apple Software, Apple Services, or Apple SDKs, and then only to provide a service or function that is directly relevant to the use of the Application, or to serve advertising in accordance with **Sections 3.3.3(E)**. You may not broaden or otherwise change the scope of usage for previously collected user or device data without obtaining prior user consent for such expanded or otherwise changed data collection. Neither You nor Your Application will use any permanent, device-based identifier, or any data derived therefrom, for purposes of uniquely identifying a device. And neither You nor Your Application will derive any data from a device for the purpose of uniquely identifying it or a user.
    
    You are responsible for ensuring that Your Application, including any third-party SDKs (i.e., an SDK not provided by Apple), complies with this Agreement and the Documentation. If Your Application uses certain APIs identified in the Documentation, the metadata in Your Application must identify one or more permitted reasons that accurately reflect Your use of each of those APIs and the data derived for their use. You may use these APIs, and the data derived from their use, for the identified reasons only. Further, if Your Application includes a third-party SDK that is identified in the Documentation as commonly used, You must ensure such third-party SDK is signed by the SDK provider and includes required metadata as described in the Documentation.
    
* **C. Disclosures to Users**
    
    You must provide clear and complete information to users regarding Your collection, use and disclosure of user or device data, e.g., a description of Your use of user and device data in the App Description on the App Store. Furthermore, You must take appropriate steps to protect such data from unauthorized use, disclosure or access by third parties. If a user ceases to consent or affirmatively revokes consent for Your collection, use or disclosure of such user’s device or user data, You (and any third party with whom You have contracted to serve advertising) must promptly cease all such use. You must provide a privacy policy in Your Application, on the App Store, and/or on Your website explaining Your collection, use, disclosure, sharing, retention, and deletion of user or device data. You agree to notify Your users, in accordance with applicable law, in the event of a data breach in which user data collected from Your Application is compromised (e.g., You will send an email notifying Your users if there has been an unintentional disclosure or misuse of their user data).
    
* **D. Legal and Other Requirements**
    
    Applications must comply with all applicable criminal, civil and statutory laws and regulations, including those in any jurisdictions in which Your Applications may be offered or made available. In addition:
    
    * You and the Application must comply with all applicable privacy and data collection laws and regulations with respect to any collection, use or disclosure of user or device data (e.g., a user’s IP address, the name of the user’s device, and any installed apps associated with a user);
    * Applications may not be designed or marketed for the purpose of harassing, abusing, spamming, stalking, threatening or otherwise violating the legal rights (such as the rights of privacy and publicity) of others;
    * Neither You nor Your Application may perform any functions or link to any content, services, information or data or use any robot, spider, site search or other retrieval application or device to scrape, mine, retrieve, cache, analyze or index software, data or services provided by Apple or its licensors, or obtain (or try to obtain) any such data, except the data that Apple expressly provides or makes available to You in connection with such services. You agree that You will not collect, disseminate or use any such data for any unauthorized purpose; and
    * If Your Application is intended for human subject research or uses the HealthKit APIs for clinical health-related uses which may involve personal data (e.g., storage of health records), then You agree to inform participants of the intended uses and disclosures of their personally identifiable data as part of such research or clinical health uses and to obtain consent from such participants (or their guardians) who will be using Your Application for such research or clinical health purposes. Further, You shall prohibit third parties to whom You provide any de-identified or coded data from re-identifying (or attempting to re-identify) any participants using such data without participant consent, and You agree to require that such third parties pass the foregoing restriction on to any other parties who receive such de-identified or coded data.
* **E. Advertising Identifier and Tracking Preference; Ad Network APIs**
    
    You and Your Applications (and any third party with whom You have contracted to serve advertising) may use the Advertising Identifier, and any information obtained through the use of the Advertising Identifier, only for the purpose of serving advertising. If a user resets the Advertising Identifier, then You agree not to combine, correlate, link or otherwise associate, either directly or indirectly, the prior Advertising Identifier and any derived information with the reset Advertising Identifier. For Applications compiled for any Apple-branded product providing access to the Ad Support APIs, You agree to check a user’s Tracking Preference prior to serving any advertising using the Advertising Identifier, and You agree to abide by a user’s setting in the Tracking Preference in Your use of the Advertising Identifier and in Your use of any other user or device data for tracking.
    
    In addition, You may request to use the Ad Network APIs to track application advertising conversion events. If You are granted permission to use the Ad Network APIs, You agree not to use such APIs, or any information obtained through the use of the Ad Network APIs, for any purpose other than verifying ad validation information as part of an advertising conversion event. You agree not to combine, correlate, link, or otherwise associate, either directly or indirectly, information that is provided as part of the ad validation through the use of the Ad Network APIs with other information You may have about a user. Apple reserves the right to reject any requests to use the Ad Network APIs, in its sole discretion.
    
* **F. Location and Maps; User Consents**
    
    (i) Applications that use location-based APIs (e.g., Core Location, MapKit API, Apple Maps Server API) or otherwise provide location-based services may not be designed or marketed for automatic or autonomous control of vehicle behavior, or for emergency or life-saving purposes.
    
    (ii) Applications that offer location-based services or functionality, or that otherwise obtain a user’s location through the use of the Apple Software or Apple Services, must notify and obtain consent from a user before a user’s location data is collected, transmitted or otherwise used by the Application and then such data must be used only as consented to by the user and as permitted herein. For example, if You use the “Always” location option in Your Application for the purpose of continuous collection and use of a user’s location data, You should provide a clearly defined justification and user benefit that is presented to the user at the time of the permission.
    
    (iii) If You choose to provide Your own location-based service, data and/or information in conjunction with the Apple maps provided through the Apple Maps Service (e.g., overlaying a map or route You have created on top of an Apple map), You are solely responsible for ensuring that Your service, data and/or information correctly aligns with any Apple maps used. For Applications that use location-based APIs for real-time navigation (including, but not limited to, turn-by-turn route guidance and other routing that is enabled through the use of a sensor), You must have an end-user license agreement that includes the following notice: YOUR USE OF THIS REAL TIME ROUTE GUIDANCE APPLICATION IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. LOCATION DATA MAY NOT BE ACCURATE.
    
    (iv) Applications must not disable, override or otherwise interfere with any Apple-implemented system alerts, warnings, display panels, consent panels and the like, including, but not limited to, those that are intended to notify the user that the user's location data, address book data, calendar, photos, audio data, and/or reminders are being collected, transmitted, maintained, processed or used, or intended to obtain consent for such use. Further, if You have the ability to add a description in such alerts, warnings, and display panels (e.g., information in the purpose strings for the Camera APIs), any such description must be accurate and not misrepresent the scope of use. If consent is denied or withdrawn, Applications may not collect, transmit, maintain, process or utilize such data or perform any other actions for which the user’s consent has been denied or withdrawn.
    
    (v) If Your Application (or Your website or web application, as applicable) uses or accesses the MapKit API, Apple Maps Server API or MapKit JS from a device running iOS version 6 or later, Your Application (or Your website or web application, as applicable) will access and use the Apple Maps Service. All use of the MapKit API, Apple Maps Server API, MapKit JS, and Apple Maps Service must be in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (including the Program Requirements) and Attachment 6 (Additional Terms for the use of the Apple Maps Service).
    
* **G. Network Extension Framework**
    
    Your Application must not access the Network Extension Framework unless Your Application is primarily designed for providing networking capabilities, and You have received an entitlement from Apple for such access. You agree to the following if You receive such entitlement:

    * You agree to store and transmit network information or data from an end-user in a secure and appropriate manner;
    * You agree not to divert an end-user’s network data or information through any undisclosed, improper, or misleading processes, e.g., to filter it through a website to obtain advertising revenue or spoof a website;
    * You agree not to use any network data or information from end-users to bypass or override any end-user settings, e.g., You may not track an end-user’s WiFi network usage to determine their location if they have disabled location services for Your Application; and
    * Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in **Section 3.3.3(B)**, You and Your Application may not use the Network Extension Framework, or any data or information obtained through the Network Extension Framework, for any purpose other than providing networking capabilities in connection with Your Application (e.g., not for using an end-user’s Internet traffic to serve advertising or to otherwise build user profiles for advertising).
    
    Apple reserves the right to not provide You with an entitlement to use the Network Extension Framework in its sole discretion and to revoke such entitlement at any time. In addition, if You would like to use the Access WiFi Information APIs (which provide the WiFi network to which a device is connected), then You must request an entitlement from Apple for such use, and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in **Section 3.3.3(B)**, You may use such APIs only for providing a service or function that is directly relevant to the Application (e.g., not for serving advertising).
    
* **H. HealthKit APIs; Motion & Fitness APIs; Journaling Suggestions APIs**
    
    Your Application must not access the HealthKit APIs or Motion & Fitness APIs unless the use of such APIs is for health, motion, and/or fitness purposes; nor may Your Application access the Journaling Suggestions API unless the use of such API is for journaling purposes.

In addition, You and Your Application must not use the Journaling Suggestions API, or collect any information through the Journaling Suggestions API, for any purposes other than providing journaling services in connection with Your Application;
    * You must not use these APIs, or any information obtained through these APIs, to disclose or provide an end-user’s health, motion, fitness, and/or journaling suggestions information to a third party without prior express end-user consent, and then only for purposes of enabling the third party to provide health, motion, fitness, and/or journaling services as permitted herein. For example, You must not share or sell information collected through these APIs to advertising platforms, data brokers, or information resellers. For clarity, You may allow end-users to consent to share data collected through the HealthKit APIs or the Motion & Fitness APIs with third parties for medical research purposes; and
    * You agree to clearly disclose to end-users how You and Your Application will be using their health, motion, fitness, and/or journaling suggestions information, and to use it only as expressly consented to by the end-user and as expressly permitted herein.
* **I. HomeKit APIs**
    
    Your Application must not access the HomeKit APIs unless it is primarily designed to provide home configuration or home automation services (e.g., turning on a light, lifting a garage door) for Licensed HomeKit Accessories and this usage is clearly evident in Your marketing text and user interface. You agree not to use the HomeKit APIs for any purpose other than interfacing, communicating, interoperating with or otherwise controlling a Licensed HomeKit Accessory or for using the HomeKit Database, and then only for home configuration or home automation purposes in connection with Your Application. In addition:
    
    * Your Application may use information obtained from the HomeKit APIs and/or the HomeKit Database only on a compatible Apple-branded product and may not export, remotely access or transfer such information off of the applicable product (e.g., a lock password cannot be sent off an end-user’s device to be stored in an external non-Apple database), unless otherwise expressly permitted by Apple in the Documentation; and
    * Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section **3.3.3(B)**, You and Your Application may not use the HomeKit APIs, or any information obtained through the HomeKit APIs or through the HomeKit Database, for any purpose other than providing or improving home configuration or home automation services in connection with Your Application (e.g., not for serving advertising).
* **J. SiriKit**
    
    (i) Your Application may register as a destination to use the Apple-defined SiriKit domains, but only if Your Application is designed to provide relevant responses to a user, or otherwise carry out the user’s request or intent, in connection with the applicable SiriKit domain (e.g., ride sharing) that is supported by Your Application and this usage is clearly evident in Your marketing text and user interface. In addition, Your Application may contribute actions to SiriKit, but only if such actions are tied to user behavior or activity within Your Application and for which You can provide a relevant response to the user. You agree not to submit false information through SiriKit about any such user activity or behavior or otherwise interfere with the predictions provided by SiriKit (e.g., SiriKit donations should be based on actual user behavior).
    
    (ii) Your Application may use information obtained through SiriKit only on supported Apple products and may not export, remotely access or transfer such information off a device except to the extent necessary to provide or improve relevant responses to a user or carry out a user’s request or in connection with Your Application. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in **Section 3.3.3(B)**, You and Your Application may not use SiriKit, or any information obtained through SiriKit, for any purpose other than providing relevant responses to a user or otherwise carrying out a user’s request or intent in connection with an SiriKit domain, intent, or action supported by Your Application and/or for improving Your Application’s responsiveness to user requests (e.g., not for serving advertising).
    
    (iii) If Your Application uses SiriKit to enable audio data to be processed by Apple, You agree to clearly disclose to end-users that You and Your Application will be sending their recorded audio data to Apple for speech recognition, processing and/or transcription purposes, and that such audio data may be used to improve and provide Apple products and services. You further agree to use such audio data, and recognized text that may be returned from SiriKit, only as expressly consented to by the end-user and as expressly permitted herein.
    
* **K. Address Book**
    
    If Your Application accesses data from an end-user’s Address Book through the Address Book API, You must notify and obtain consent from the user before a user’s Address Book data is accessed or used by Your Application. Further, Your Application may not provide an automated mechanism that transfers only the Facebook Data portions of the end-user’s Address Book altogether to a location off of the end-user’s device. For the sake of clarity, this does not prohibit an automated transfer of the user’s entire Address Book as a whole, so long as user notification and consent requirements have been fulfilled; and does not prohibit enabling users to transfer any portion of their Address Book data manually (e.g., by cutting and pasting) or enabling them to individually select particular data items to be transferred.
    
* **L. Face Data**
    
    If Your Application accesses Face Data, then You must do so only to provide a service or function that is directly relevant to the use of the Application, and You agree to inform users of Your intended uses and disclosures of Face Data by Your Application and to obtain clear and conspicuous consent from such users before any collection or use of Face Data. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 3.3.3(B), neither You nor Your Application (nor any third party with whom You have contracted to serve advertising) may use Face Data for serving advertising or for any other unrelated purposes. In addition:
    
    * You may not use Face Data in a manner that will violate the legal rights of Your users (or any third parties) or to provide an unlawful, unfair, misleading, fraudulent, improper, exploitative, or objectionable user experience and then only in accordance with the Documentation;

    * You agree not to transfer, share, sell, or otherwise provide Face Data to advertising platforms, analytics providers, data brokers, information resellers or other such parties; and
    * Face Data may not be shared or transferred off the user’s device unless You have obtained clear and conspicuous consent for the transfer and the Face Data is used only in fulfilling a specific service or function for Your Application (e.g., a face mesh is used to display an image of the user within the Application) and only in accordance with these terms and the Documentation. You agree to require that Your service providers use Face Data only to the limited extent consented to by the user and only in accordance with these terms.
* **M. Background Assets Framework**
    
    You may use the Background Assets Framework only to download additional assets for Your Application distributed through the App Store or for beta testing through TestFlight; no other use is permitted. You may not use the Background Assets Framework to collect or transmit data in order to identify a user or device, or to perform advertising or advertising measurement.

To have Your macOS Application notarized, You may request a digital file for authentication of Your Application from Apple’s digital notary service (a “**Ticket**”). You can use this Ticket with Your Apple Certificate to receive an improved developer signing and user experience for Your Application on macOS. To request this Ticket from Apple’s digital notary service, You must upload Your Application to Apple through Apple’s developer tools (or other requested mechanisms) for purposes of continuous security checking. This continuous security checking will involve automated scanning, testing, and analysis of Your Application by Apple for malware or other harmful or suspicious code or components or security flaws, and, in limited cases, a manual, technical investigation of Your Application by Apple for such purposes. By uploading Your Application to Apple for this digital notary service, You agree that Apple may perform such security checks on Your Application for purposes of detecting malware or other harmful or suspicious code or components, and You agree that Apple may retain and use Your Application for subsequent security checks for the same purposes.

If Apple authenticates Your developer signature and Your Application passes the initial security checks, Apple may provide You with a Ticket to use with Your Apple Certificate. Apple reserves the right to issue Tickets in its sole discretion, and Apple may revoke Tickets at any time in its sole discretion in the event that Apple has reason to believe, or has reasonable suspicions, that Your Application contains malware or malicious, suspicious or harmful code or components or that Your developer identity signature has been compromised. You may request that Apple revoke Your Ticket at any time by emailing: product-security@apple.com. If Apple revokes Your Ticket or Your Apple Certificate, then Your Application may no longer run on macOS.

You agree to cooperate with Apple regarding Your Ticket requests and to not hide, attempt to bypass, or misrepresent any part of Your Application from Apple’s security checks or otherwise hinder Apple from being able to perform such security checks. You agree not to represent that Apple has performed a security check or malware detection for Your Application or that Apple has reviewed or approved Your Application for purposes of issuing a Ticket to You from Apple’s digital notary service. You acknowledge and agree that Apple is performing security checks solely in connection with Apple’s digital notary service and that such security checks should not be relied upon for malware detection or security verification of any kind. You are fully responsible for Your own Application and for ensuring that Your Application is safe, secure, and operational for Your end-users (e.g., informing Your end-users that Your Application may cease to run if there is an issue with malware). You agree to comply with export requirements in Your jurisdiction when uploading Your Application to Apple, and You agree not to upload any Application that is: (a) subject to the United States Export Administration Regulations, 15 C.F.R. Parts 730-774 or to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, 22 C.F.R. Parts 120-130; or (b) that cannot be exported without prior written government authorization, including, but not limited to, certain types of encryption software and source code, without first obtaining that authorization. Apple will not be liable to You or any third party for any inability or failure to detect any malware or other suspicious, harmful code or components in Your Application or Your Corresponding Products or other security issues, or for any ticket issuance or revocation. Apple shall not be responsible for any costs, expenses, damages, losses or other liabilities You may incur as a result of Your Application development, Your Corresponding Product development, use of the Apple Software, Apple Services (including this digital notary service), or Apple Certificates, tickets, or participation in the Program, including without limitation the fact that Apple performs security checks on Your Application.

#### 5.4 Certificate Revocation

Except as otherwise set forth herein, You may revoke Apple Certificates issued to You at any time. If You want to revoke the Apple Certificates used to sign Your Passes and/or issued to You for use with Your macOS Applications distributed outside of the App Store, You may request that Apple revoke these Apple Certificates at any time by emailing: product-security@apple.com. Apple also reserves the right to revoke any Apple Certificates at any time, in its sole discretion. By way of example only, Apple may choose to do this if: (a) any of Your Apple Certificates or corresponding private keys have been compromised or Apple has reason to believe that either have been compromised; (b) Apple has reason to believe or has reasonable suspicions that Your Covered Products or Corresponding Products contain malware or malicious, suspicious or harmful code or components (e.g., a software virus); (c) Apple has reason to believe that Your Covered Products adversely affect the security of Apple-branded products, or any other software, firmware, hardware, data, systems, or networks accessed or used by such products; (d) Apple’s certificate issuance process is compromised or Apple has reason to believe that such process has been compromised; (e) You breach any term or condition of this Agreement; (f) Apple ceases to issue the Apple Certificates for the Covered Product or Corresponding Product under the Program; (g) Your Covered Product or Corresponding Product misuses or overburdens any Services provided hereunder; or (h) Apple has reason to believe that such action is prudent or necessary. Further, You understand and agree that Apple may notify end-users of Covered Products or Corresponding Products that are signed with Apple Certificates when Apple believes such action is necessary to protect the privacy, safety or security of end-users, or is otherwise prudent or necessary as determined in Apple’s reasonable judgment.

If requested by Apple, You agree to provide access to or samples of any such devices at Your expense (samples will not be returned). You agree to cooperate with Apple in this submission process and to answer questions and provide information and materials reasonably requested by Apple regarding Your submitted Application, including insurance information You may have relating to Your Application, the operation of Your business, or Your obligations under this Agreement. Apple may require You to carry certain levels of insurance for certain types of Applications and name Apple as an additional insured. If You make any changes to an Application (including to any functionality made available through use of the In-App Purchase API) after submission to Apple, You must resubmit the Application to Apple. Similarly all bug fixes, updates, upgrades, modifications, enhancements, supplements to, revisions, new releases and new versions of Your Application must be submitted to Apple for review in order for them to be considered for distribution via the App Store or Custom App Distribution, except as otherwise permitted by Apple.

#### 6.2 App Thinning and Bundled Resources

As part of Your Application submission to the App Store or Custom App Distribution, Apple may optimize Your Application to target specific devices by repackaging certain functionality and delivered resources (as described in the Documentation) in Your Application so that it will run more efficiently and use less space on target devices (“**App Thinning**”). For example, Apple may deliver only the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Your Application to a target device, and Apple may not deliver icons or launch screens that would not render on the display of a target device. You agree that Apple may use App Thinning to repackage Your Application in order to deliver a more optimized version of Your Application to target devices.

As part of App Thinning, You can also request that Apple deliver specific resources for Your Application (e.g., GPU resources) to target devices by identifying such bundled resources as part of Your code submission (“**Bundled Resources**”). You can define such Bundled Resources to vary the timing or delivery of assets to a target device (e.g., when a user reaches a certain level of a game, then the content is delivered on-demand to the target device). App Thinning and Bundled Resources are not available for all Apple operating systems, and Apple may continue to deliver full Application binaries to some target devices.

#### 6.3 iOS and iPadOS apps on macOS and visionOS

If You compile Your Application for iOS and/or iPadOS and submit such Application for distribution on the App Store, You agree that Apple will also make Your Application available on macOS and visionOS via the App Store, unless You opt out of making Your Application available on macOS and/or visionOS by following the opt out process in App Store Connect. You agree that the foregoing applies to an Application for iOS and/or iPadOS submitted by You and currently available on the App Store, and to any future Application compiled for iOS and/or iPadOS and submitted by You to the App Store. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such availability on the App Store will apply only if such Application has been selected by Apple for distribution on the App Store pursuant to Section 7 and only if such Application can function appropriately on, and be compatible with, macOS and/or visionOS (as applicable), as determined in Apple’s sole discretion. You are responsible for obtaining and determining whether You have appropriate rights for Your Application to operate on macOS and/or visionOS. If You do not have such rights, You agree to opt out of making such Application available on macOS and/or visionOS. You are responsible for testing such Application on macOS and visionOS.

#### 6.4 Bitcode Submissions

For Application submissions to the App Store or Custom App Distribution for some Apple operating systems (e.g., for watchOS), Apple may require You to submit an intermediate representation of Your Application in binary file format for the LLVM compiler (“**Bitcode**”). You may also submit Bitcode for other supported Apple operating systems. Such Bitcode submission will allow Apple to compile Your Bitcode to target specific Apple-branded devices and to recompile Your Bitcode for subsequent releases of Your Application for new Apple hardware, software, and/or compiler changes. When submitting Bitcode, You may choose whether or not to include symbols for Your Application in the Bitcode; however, if You do not include symbols, then Apple will not be able to provide You with symbolicated crash logs or other diagnostic information as set forth in **Section 6.6 (Improving Your Application)** below. Further, You may be required to submit a compiled binary of Your Application with Your Bitcode.

By submitting Bitcode to Apple, You authorize Apple to compile Your Bitcode into a resulting binary that will be targeted for specific Apple-branded devices and to recompile Your Bitcode for subsequent rebuilding and recompiling of Your Application for updated hardware, software, and/or compiler changes (e.g., if Apple releases a new device, then Apple may use Your Bitcode to update Your Application without requiring resubmission). You agree that Apple may compile such Bitcode for its own internal use in testing and improving Apple’s developer tools, and for purposes of analyzing and improving how applications can be optimized to run on Apple’s operating systems (e.g., which frameworks are used most frequently, how a certain framework consumes memory, etc.). You may use Apple’s developer tools to view and test how Apple may process Your Bitcode into machine code binary form. Bitcode is not available for all Apple operating systems.

#### 6.5 TestFlight Submission

If You would like to distribute Your Application to Beta Testers outside of Your company or organization through TestFlight, You must first submit Your Application to Apple for review. By submitting such Application, You represent and warrant that Your Application complies with the Documentation and Program Requirements then in effect as well as with any additional guidelines that Apple may post on the Program web portal or in App Store Connect. Apple may use Licensed Application Information You have submitted with other versions of Your Application approved for distribution to display, market, or deliver pre-release versions of Your Application to Beta Testers through TestFlight. You may opt out of such use of Licensed Application Information with pre-release versions of Your Applications in App Store Connect, and You agree that You will opt out if at any point the Licensed Application Information is not representative of the pre-release version of Your Application.

Thereafter, Apple may permit You to distribute updates to such Application directly to Your Beta Testers without Apple’s review, unless such an update includes significant changes, in which case You agree to inform Apple in App Store Connect and have such Application re-reviewed. Apple reserves the right to require You to cease distribution of Your Application through TestFlight, and/or to any particular Beta Tester, at any time in its sole discretion.

#### 6.6 Improving Your Application

Further, if Your Application is submitted for distribution via the App Store, Custom App Distribution or TestFlight, You agree that Apple may use Your Application for the limited purpose of compatibility testing of Your Application with Apple products and services, for finding and fixing bugs and issues in Apple products and services and/or Your Applications, for internal use in evaluating iOS, watchOS, tvOS, iPadOS, visionOS, and/or macOS performance issues in or with Your Application, for security testing, and for purposes of providing other information to You (e.g., crash logs). Except as otherwise set forth herein, You may opt in to send app symbol information for Your Application to Apple, and if You do so, then You agree that Apple may use such symbols to symbolicate Your Application for purposes of providing You with symbolicated crash logs and other diagnostic information, compatibility testing of Your Application with Apple products and services, and for finding and fixing bugs and issues in Apple products and services and/or Your Application. In the event that Apple provides You with crash logs or other diagnostic information for Your Application, You agree to use such crash logs and information only for purposes of fixing bugs and improving the performance of Your Application and related products. You may also collect numeric strings and variables from Your Application when it crashes, so long as You collect such information only in an anonymous, non-personal manner and do not recombine, correlate, or use such information to attempt to identify or derive information about any particular end-user or device.

#### 6.7 Analytics

You agree to use any data Apple provides through analytics services for Applications solely for improving Your Applications and related products. Further, You agree not to provide such data to any third parties, except for a Service Provider. The Service Provider must be assisting with processing and analyzing such data on Your behalf, and not be permitted to use it for any other purpose or disclose it to any other party. For instance, You must not aggregate (or permit any third-party to aggregate) data provided to You by Apple as part of these services with other developers’ analytics information.Nor may you contribute such information to a repository for cross-developer analytics. And You must not use the analytics services or any analytics data to attempt to identify or derive information about any particular end-user or device. For clarity, this paragraph does not prohibit sharing or uses expressly permitted by law.

Apple may provide You with data in App Analytics about the performance of Your Applications relative to similar Applications on the App Store. This data is calculated using differential privacy to protect the Applications and end users. At all times, Your personal data will be handled in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, which can be viewed at https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/.

#### 6.8 Compatibility Requirement with Current Shipping OS Version

Applications that are selected for distribution via the App Store must be compatible with the currently shipping version of Apple’s applicable operating system (OS) software at the time of submission to Apple, and such Applications must stay current and maintain compatibility with each new release of the applicable OS version so long as such Applications are distributed through the App Store. You understand and agree that Apple may remove Applications from the App Store when they are not compatible with the then-current shipping release of the OS at any time in its sole discretion.

#### 6.9 Selection by Apple for Distribution

You understand and agree that if You submit Your Application to Apple for distribution via the App Store, Custom App Distribution, or TestFlight, Apple may, in its sole discretion:

1. determine that Your Application does not meet all or any part of the Documentation or Program Requirements then in effect;
2. reject Your Application for distribution for any reason, even if Your Application meets the Documentation and Program Requirements; or
3. select and digitally sign Your Application for distribution via the App Store, Custom App Distribution, or TestFlight.

Apple shall not be responsible for any costs, expenses, damages, losses (including without limitation lost business opportunities or lost profits) or other liabilities You may incur as a result of Your Application development, use of the Apple Software, Apple Services, or Apple Certificates or participation in the Program, including without limitation the fact that Your Application may not be selected for distribution via the App Store or Custom App Distribution. You will be solely responsible for developing Applications that are safe, free of defects in design and operation, and comply with applicable laws and regulations. You will also be solely responsible for any documentation and end-user customer support and warranty for such Applications. The fact that Apple may have reviewed, tested, approved or selected an Application will not relieve You of any of these responsibilities.

### 7\. Distribution of Applications and Libraries

##### Applications:

Applications developed under this Agreement for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, or watchOS can be distributed: (1) through the App Store, if selected by Apple, (2) through Ad Hoc distribution in accordance with **Section 7.3**, and (3) for beta testing through TestFlight in accordance with **Section 7.4**.

#### 7.2 Schedule 2 and Schedule 3 for Fee-Based Licensed Applications; Receipts

If Your Application qualifies as a Licensed Application and You intend to charge end-users a fee of any kind for Your Licensed Application or within Your Licensed Application through the use of the In-App Purchase API, You must enter into a separate agreement (Schedule 2) with Apple and/or an Apple Subsidiary before any such commercial distribution of Your Licensed Application may take place via the App Store or before any such commercial delivery of additional content, functionality or services for which You charge end-users a fee may be authorized through the use of the In-App Purchase API in Your Licensed Application. If You would like Apple to sign and distribute Your Application for a fee through Custom App Distribution, then You must enter into a separate agreement (Schedule 3) with Apple and/or an Apple Subsidiary before any such distribution may take place. To the extent that You enter (or have previously entered) into Schedule 2 or Schedule 3 with Apple and/or an Apple Subsidiary, the terms of Schedule 2 or 3 will be deemed incorporated into this Agreement by this reference.

When an end-user installs Your Licensed Application, Apple will provide You with a transaction receipt signed with an Apple Certificate. It is Your responsibility to verify that such certificate and receipt were issued by Apple, as set forth in the Documentation. You are solely responsible for Your decision to rely on any such certificates and receipts. YOUR USE OF OR RELIANCE ON SUCH CERTIFICATES AND RECEIPTS IN CONNECTION WITH A PURCHASE OF A LICENSED APPLICATION IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. APPLE MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, SECURITY, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO SUCH APPLE CERTIFICATES AND RECEIPTS.

### Attachment 1

**(to the Agreement)**

**Additional Terms for Apple Push Notification Service and Local Notifications**

The following terms are in addition to the terms of the Agreement and apply to any use of the APN (Apple Push Notification Service):

#### 1\. Use of the APN and Local Notifications

**1.1** You may use the APN only in Your Applications, Your Passes, and/or in sending Safari Push Notifications to the macOS desktop of users of Your Site who have opted in to receive Notifications through Safari on macOS. You, Your Application and/or Your Pass may access the APN only via the APN API and only if You have been assigned a Push Application ID by Apple. Except for a Service Provider who is assisting You with using the APN, You agree not to share Your Push Application ID with any third party. You understand that You will not be permitted to access or use the APN after expiration or termination of Your Agreement.

**1.2** You are permitted to use the APN and the APN APIs only for the purpose of sending Push Notifications to Your Application, Your Pass, and/or to the macOS desktop of users of Your Site who have opted in to receive Notifications through Safari on macOS as expressly permitted by the Agreement, the APN Documentation and all applicable laws and regulations (including all intellectual property laws). You further agree that You must disclose to Apple any use of the APN as part of the submission process for Your Application.

**1.3** You understand that before You send an end-user any Push Notifications through the APN, the end-user must consent to receive such Notifications. You agree not to disable, override or otherwise interfere with any Apple-implemented consent panels or any Apple system preferences for enabling or disabling Notification functionality. If the end-user’s consent to receive Push Notifications is denied or later withdrawn, You may not send the end-user Push Notifications.

#### 2\. Additional Requirements

**2.1** You may not use the APN or Local Notifications for the purpose of sending unsolicited messages to end-users or for the purpose of phishing or spamming, including, but not limited to, engaging in any types of activities that violate anti-spamming laws and regulations, or that are otherwise improper, inappropriate or illegal. The APN and Local Notifications should be used for sending relevant messages to a user that provide a benefit (e.g., a response to an end-user request for information, provision of pertinent information relevant to the Application).

**2.2** You may not use the APN or Local Notifications for the purposes of advertising, product promotion, or direct marketing of any kind (e.g., up-selling, cross-selling, etc.), including, but not limited to, sending any messages to promote the use of Your Application or advertise the availability of new features or versions, unless the end user has explicitly opted in to receive them via consent language displayed in Your Application’s user interface, and You provide a method in Your Application for the end user to opt out from receiving such messages. Notwithstanding the foregoing, You may use the APN or Local Notifications for promotional purposes in connection with Your Pass so long as such use is directly related to the Pass, e.g., a store coupon may be sent to Your Pass in Wallet.

**2.3** You may not excessively use the overall network capacity or bandwidth of the APN, or unduly burden an Apple-branded product or an end-user with excessive Push Notifications or Local Notifications, as may be determined by Apple in its reasonable discretion. In addition, You agree not to harm or interfere with Apple’s networks or servers, or any third-party servers or networks connected to the APN, or otherwise disrupt other developers’ use of the APN.

**2.4** You may not use the APN or Local Notifications to send material that contains any obscene, pornographic, offensive or defamatory content or materials of any kind (text, graphics, images, photographs, sounds, etc.), or other content or materials that in Apple’s reasonable judgment may be found objectionable by the end-user of Your Application, Pass or Site.

**2.5** You may not transmit, store or otherwise make available any material that contains viruses or any other computer code, files or programs that may harm, disrupt or limit the normal operation of the APN or an Apple-branded product, and You agree not to disable, spoof, hack or otherwise interfere with any security, digital signing, verification or authentication mechanisms that are incorporated in or used by the APN, or enable others to do so.

#### 3\. Additional Terms for Website Push IDs

**3.1** Subject to the terms of this Agreement, You understand and agree that Safari Push Notifications that You send using Your Website Push ID must be sent under Your own name, trademark or brand (e.g., a user should know that the communication is coming from Your Site) and must include an icon, trademark, logo or other identifying mark for Your Site. You agree not to misrepresent or impersonate another Site or entity or otherwise mislead users about the originator of the Safari Push Notification. To the extent that You reference a third party’s trademark or brand within Your Safari Push Notification, You represent and warrant that You have any necessary rights.

**3.2** By enabling the APN and sending Safari Push Notifications for Your Site as permitted in this Agreement, You hereby permit Apple to use (i) screenshots of Your Safari Push Notifications on macOS; and (ii) trademarks and logos associated with such Notifications, for promotional purposes in Apple’s marketing materials, excluding those portions which You do not have the right to use for promotional purposes and which You identify in writing to Apple. You also permit Apple to use images and other materials that You may provide to Apple, at Apple’s reasonable request, for promotional purposes in marketing materials.

#### 4\. Delivery by the APN or via Local Notifications

You understand and agree that in order to provide the APN and make Your Push Notifications available on Apple-branded products, Apple may transmit Your Push Notifications across various public networks, in various media, and modify or change Your Push Notifications to comply with the technical and other requirements for connecting to networks or devices. You acknowledge and agree that the APN is not, and is not intended to be, a guaranteed or secure delivery service, and You shall not use or rely upon it as such. Further, as a condition to using the APN or delivering Local Notifications, You agree not to transmit sensitive personal or confidential information belonging to an individual (e.g., a social security number, financial account or transactional information, or any information where the individual may have a reasonable expectation of secure transmission) as part of any such Notification, and You agree to comply with any applicable notice or consent requirements with respect to any collection, transmission, maintenance, processing or use of an end-user’s personal information.

#### 5\. Your Acknowledgements

You acknowledge and agree that:

**5.1** Apple may at any time, and from time to time, with or without prior notice to You (a) modify the APN, including changing or removing any feature or functionality, or (b) modify, deprecate, reissue or republish the APN APIs. You understand that any such modifications may require You to change or update Your Applications, Passes or Sites at Your own cost. Apple has no express or implied obligation to provide, or continue to provide, the APN and may suspend or discontinue all or any portion of the APN at any time. Apple shall not be liable for any losses, damages or costs of any kind incurred by You or any other party arising out of or related to any such service suspension or discontinuation or any such modification of the APN or APN APIs.

**5.2** The APN is not available in all languages or in all countries or regions and Apple makes no representation that the APN is appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent You choose to access and use the APN, You do so at Your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to any local laws.

**5.3** Apple provides the APN to You for Your use with Your Application, Pass, or Site, and does not provide the APN directly to any end-user. You acknowledge and agree that any Push Notifications are sent by You, not Apple, to the end-user of Your Application, Pass or Site, and You are solely liable and responsible for any data or content transmitted therein and for any such use of the APN. Further, You acknowledge and agree that any Local Notifications are sent by You, not Apple, to the end-user of Your Application, and You are solely liable and responsible for any data or content transmitted therein.

**5.4** Apple makes no guarantees to You in relation to the availability or uptime of the APN and is not obligated to provide any maintenance, technical or other support for the APN.

**5.5** Apple reserves the right to remove Your access to the APN, limit Your use of the APN, or revoke Your Push Application ID at any time in its sole discretion.

**5.6** Apple may monitor and collect information (including but not limited to technical and diagnostic information) about Your usage of the APN to aid Apple in improving the APN and other Apple products or services and to verify Your compliance with this Agreement; provided however that Apple will not access or disclose the content of any Push Notification unless Apple has a good faith belief that such access or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process or request; (b) enforce the terms of this Agreement, including investigation of any potential violation hereof; (c) detect, prevent or otherwise address security, fraud or technical issues; or (d) protect the rights, property or safety of Apple, its developers, customers or the public as required or permitted by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, You acknowledge and agree that iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS may access Push Notifications locally on a user’s device solely for the purposes of responding to user requests and personalizing user experience and suggestions on device.

#### 6\. Additional Liability Disclaimer

APPLE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OR LOSSES ARISING FROM ANY USE OF THE APN, INCLUDING ANY INTERRUPTIONS TO THE APN OR ANY USE OF NOTIFICATIONS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY POWER OUTAGES, SYSTEM FAILURES, NETWORK ATTACKS, SCHEDULED OR UNSCHEDULED MAINTENANCE, OR OTHER INTERRUPTIONS.

### Attachment 2

**(to the Agreement)**

**Additional Terms for Use of the In-App Purchase API**

#### 1\. Use of the In-App Purchase API

**1.1** You may use the In-App Purchase API only to enable end-users to access or receive content, functionality, or services that You make available for use within Your Application (e.g., digital books, additional game levels, access to a turn-by-turn map service). You may not use the In-App Purchase API to offer goods or services to be used outside of Your Application.

**1.2** You must submit to Apple for review and approval all content, functionality, or services that You plan to provide through the use of the In-App Purchase API in accordance with these terms and the processes set forth in **Section 6 (Application Submission and Selection)** of the Agreement. For all submissions, You must provide the name, text description, price, unique identifier number, and other information that Apple reasonably requests (collectively, the “**Submission Description**”). Apple reserves the right to review the actual content, functionality or service that has been described in the Submission Descriptions at any time, including, but not limited to, in the submission process and after approval of the Submission Description by Apple. If You would like to provide additional content, functionality or services through the In-App Purchase API that are not described in Your Submission Description, then You must first submit a new or updated Submission Description for review and approval by Apple prior to making such items available through the use of the In-App Purchase API. Apple reserves the right to withdraw its approval of content, functionality, or services previously approved, and You agree to stop making any such content, functionality, or services available for use within Your Application.

**1.3** All content, functionality, and services offered through the In-App Purchase API are subject to the Program Requirements for Applications, and after such content, services or functionality are added to a Licensed Application, they will be deemed part of the Licensed Application and will be subject to all the same obligations and requirements. For clarity, Applications that provide keyboard extension functionality may not use the In-App Purchase API within the keyboard extension itself; however, they may continue to use the In-App Purchase API in separate areas of the Application.

**2.2** All Licensed Applications will be delivered by You to Apple using software tools, a secure FTP site address and/or such other delivery methods as prescribed by Apple.

**2.3** You hereby certify that all of the Licensed Applications You deliver to Apple under this Schedule 1 are authorized for export from the United States to each of the regions designated by You under Section 2.1 hereof, in accordance with the requirements of all applicable laws, including but not limited to the United States Export Administration Regulations, 15 C.F.R. Parts 730-774. You further represent and warrant that all versions of the Licensed Applications You deliver to Apple are not subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations 22 C.F.R. Parts 120-130 and are not designed, made, modified or configured for any military end users or end uses as defined and scoped in 15 C.F.R § 744. Without limiting the generality of this Section 2.3, You certify that (i) none of the Licensed Applications contains, uses or supports any data encryption or cryptographic functions; or (ii) in the event that any Licensed Application contains, uses or supports any such data encryption or cryptographic functionality, You certify that You have complied with the United States Export Administration Regulations, and are in possession of, and will, upon request, provide Apple with PDF copies of export classification ruling (CCATS) issued by the United States Commerce Department, Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) or any self-classification reports submitted to the BIS, and appropriate authorizations from other regions that mandate import authorizations for that Licensed Application, as required. You acknowledge that Apple is relying upon Your certification in this Section 2.3 in allowing end-users to access and download the Licensed Applications under this Schedule 1.

Where applicable, you shall also be responsible for providing any content restriction tools or age verification functionality before enabling end-users to access mature or otherwise regulated content within Your Licensed Application.

#### 3\. Ownership and End-User Licensing and Delivery of the Licensed Applications to End Users

**3.1** You acknowledge and agree that Apple, in the course of acting as agent and/or commissionaire for You, is hosting, or pursuant to Section 1.2(b) of this Schedule 1 may enable authorized third parties to host, the Licensed Application(s), and is allowing the download of those Licensed Application(s) by end-users, on Your behalf. However, You are responsible for hosting and delivering content or services sold or delivered by You using the In-App Purchase API, except for content that is included within the Licensed Application itself (i.e., the In-App Purchase simply unlocks the content) or content hosted by Apple pursuant to Section 3.3 of Attachment 2 of the Agreement. The parties acknowledge and agree that Apple shall not acquire any ownership interest in or to any of the Licensed Applications or Licensed Applications Information, and title, risk of loss, responsibility for, and control over the Licensed Applications shall, at all times, remain with You. Apple may not use any of the Licensed Applications or Licensed Application Information for any purpose, or in any manner, except as specifically authorized in the Agreement or this Schedule 1.

**3.2** You may deliver to Apple Your own EULA for any Licensed Application at the time that You deliver that Licensed Application to Apple, in accordance with Section 2.1 of this Schedule 1; provided, however, that Your EULA must include and may not be inconsistent with the minimum terms and conditions specified on Exhibit B to this Schedule 1 and must comply with all applicable laws in all regions where You wish Apple to allow end-users to download that Licensed Application. Apple shall enable each end-user to review Your EULA (if any) at the time that Apple delivers that Licensed Application to that end-user, and Apple shall notify each end-user that the end-user’s use of that Licensed Application is subject to the terms and conditions of Your EULA (if any). In the event that You do not furnish Your own EULA for any Licensed Application to Apple, You acknowledge and agree that each end-user’s use of that Licensed Application shall be subject to Apple’s standard EULA (which is part of the App Store Terms of Service).

**3.3** You hereby acknowledge that the EULA for each of the Licensed Applications is solely between You and the end-user and conforms to applicable law, and Apple shall not be responsible for, and shall not have any liability whatsoever under, any EULA or any breach by You or any end-user of any of the terms and conditions of any EULA.

**3.4** A Licensed Application may read or play content (magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, video) that is offered outside of the Licensed Application (such as, by way of example, through Your website) provided that You do not link to or market external offers for such content within the Licensed Application. You are responsible for authentication access to content acquired outside of the Licensed Application.

**3.5** To the extent You promote and offer in-app subscriptions, You must do so in compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements.

**3.6** If Your Licensed Application is periodical content-based (e.g., magazines and newspapers), Apple may provide You with the name, email address, and zip code associated with an end-user’s account when they request an auto-renewing subscription via the In-App Purchase API, provided that such user consents to the provision of data to You, and further provided that You may only use such data to promote Your own products and do so in strict compliance with Your publicly posted Privacy Policy, a copy of which must be readily viewed and is consented to in Your Licensed Application.

#### 4\. Content Restrictions and Software Rating

**4.1** You represent and warrant that: (a) You have the right to enter into this Agreement, to reproduce and distribute each of the Licensed Applications, and to authorize Apple to permit end-users to download and use each of the Licensed Applications through one or more App Stores or the Custom App Distribution Site; (b) none of the Licensed Applications, or Apple’s or end-users’ permitted uses of those Licensed Applications, violate or infringe any patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property or contractual rights of any other person, firm, corporation or other entity and that You are not submitting the Licensed Applications to Apple on behalf of one or more third parties; (c) none of the Custom Apps, or Apple’s or end-users’ permitted uses of those Custom Apps, violate or infringe any patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property or contractual rights of any other person, firm, corporation or other entity and that You are not submitting the Custom Apps to Apple on behalf of one or more third parties other than under license grant from one or more third parties subject to Apple’s Volume Content Terms and/or Custom App Distribution; (d) each of the Licensed Applications is authorized for distribution, sale and use in, export to, and import into each of the regions designated by You under Section 2.1 of this Schedule 1, in accordance with the laws and regulations of those regions and all applicable export/import regulations; (e) none of the Licensed Applications contains any obscene, offensive or other materials that are prohibited or restricted under the laws or regulations of any of the regions You designate under Section 2.1 of this Schedule 1; (f) all information You provide using the App Store Connect tool, including any information relating to the Licensed Applications, is accurate and that, if any such information ceases to be accurate, You will promptly update it to be accurate using the App Store Connect tool; and (g) in the event a dispute arises over the content of Your Licensed Applications or use of Your intellectual property on the App Store or the Custom App Distribution Site, You agree to permit Apple to share Your contact information with the party filing such dispute and to follow Apple’s app dispute process on a non-exclusive basis and without any party waiving its legal rights.

**4.2** You shall use the software rating tool set forth on App Store Connect to supply information regarding each of the Licensed Applications delivered by You for marketing and fulfillment by Apple through the App Store or the Custom App Distribution Site under this Schedule 1 in order to assign a rating to each such Licensed Application. For purposes of assigning a rating to each of the Licensed Applications, You shall use Your best efforts to provide correct and complete information about the content of that Licensed Application with the software rating tool. You acknowledge and agree that Apple is relying on: (i) Your good faith and diligence in accurately and completely providing the requested information for each Licensed Application; and (ii) Your representations and warranties in Section 4.1 hereof, in making that Licensed Application available for download by end-users in each of the regions You designate hereunder. Furthermore, You authorize Apple to correct the rating of any Licensed Application of Yours that has been assigned an incorrect rating; and You agree to any such corrected rating.

**4.3** In the event that any region You designate hereunder requires the approval of, or rating of, any Licensed Application by any government or industry regulatory agency as a condition for the distribution and/or use of that Licensed Application, You acknowledge and agree that Apple may elect not to make that Licensed Application available for download by end-users in that region from any App Stores or the Custom App Distribution Site.

#### 5\. Responsibility and Liability

**5.1** Apple shall have no responsibility for the installation and/or use of any of the Licensed Applications by any end-user. You shall be solely responsible for any and all product warranties, end-user assistance and product support with respect to each of the Licensed Applications.

**5.2** You shall be solely responsible for, and Apple shall have no responsibility or liability whatsoever with respect to, any and all claims, suits, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses arising from, or attributable to, the Licensed Applications and/or the use of those Licensed Applications by any end-user, including, but not limited to: (i) claims of breach of warranty, whether specified in the EULA or established under applicable law; (ii) product liability claims; and (iii) claims that any of the Licensed Applications and/or the end-user’s possession or use of those Licensed Applications infringes the copyright or other intellectual property rights of any third party.

#### 6\. Termination

**6.1** This Schedule 1, and all of Apple’s obligations hereunder, shall terminate upon the expiration or termination of the Agreement.

**6.2** In the event that You no longer have the legal right to distribute the Licensed Applications, or to authorize Apple to allow access to those Licensed Applications by end-users, in accordance with this Schedule 1, You shall promptly notify Apple and withdraw those Licensed Applications from the App Store or the Custom App Distribution Site using the tools provided on the App Store Connect site; provided, however, that such withdrawal by You under this Section 6.2 shall not relieve You of any of Your obligations to Apple under this Schedule 1, or any liability to Apple and/or any end-user with respect to those Licensed Applications.

**6.3** Apple reserves the right to cease marketing, offering, and allowing download by end-users of the Licensed Applications at any time, with or without cause, by providing notice of termination to You. Without limiting the generality of this Section 6.3, You acknowledge that Apple may cease allowing download by end-users of some or all of the Licensed Applications, or take other interim measures in Apple’s sole discretion, if Apple reasonably believes, based human and/or systematic review, and, including without limitation upon notice received under applicable laws, that: (i) those Licensed Applications are not authorized for export to one or more of the regions designated by You under Section 2.1 hereof, in accordance with the Export Administration Regulations or other restrictions; (ii) those Licensed Applications and/or any end-user’s possession and/or use of those Licensed Applications, infringe patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property rights of any third party; (iii) the distribution and/or use of those Licensed Applications violates any applicable law in any region You designate under Section 2.1 of this Schedule 1; (iv) You have violated the terms of the Agreement, this Schedule 1, or other documentation including without limitation the App Review Guidelines; or (v) You or anyone representing You or Your company are subject to sanctions of any region in which Apple operates. An election by Apple to cease allowing download of any Licensed Applications, pursuant to this Section 6.3, shall not relieve You of Your obligations under this Schedule 1.

**6.4** You may withdraw any or all of the Licensed Applications from the App Store or the Custom App Distribution Site, at any time, and for any reason, by using the tools provided on the App Store Connect site, except that, with respect to Your end-users, You hereby authorize and instruct Apple to fulfill sections 1.2(b), (c), and (d) of this Schedule 1, which shall survive termination or expiration of the Agreement unless You indicate otherwise pursuant to sections 4.1 and 6.2 of this Schedule 1.

### EXHIBIT D

(to Schedule 1)

**Additional App Store Terms**

**1\. Discoverability on the App Store:** The discoverability of Your Licensed Application in the App Store depends on several factors, and Apple is under no obligation to display, feature, or rank Your Licensed Application in any particular manner or order in the App Store.

1. The main parameters used for app ranking and discoverability are text relevance, such as using an accurate title, adding relevant keywords/metadata, and selecting descriptive categories in the Licensed Application; customer behavior relating to the number and quality of ratings and reviews and application downloads; date of launch in the App Store may also be considered for relevant searches; and whether You have violated any rules promulgated by Apple.  These main parameters deliver the most relevant results to customer search queries.
2. When considering apps to feature in the App Store, our editors look for high-quality apps across all categories, with a particular focus on new apps and apps with significant updates. The main parameters that our editors consider are UI design, user experience, innovation and uniqueness, localizations, accessibility, App Store product page screenshots, app previews, and descriptions; and additionally, for games, gameplay, graphics and performance, audio, narrative and story depth, ability to replay, and gameplay controls. These main parameters showcase high-quality, well-designed, and innovative apps.
3. If You use an Apple service for paid promotion of Your app on the App Store, Your app may be presented in a promotional placement and designated as advertising content.

To learn more about app discoverability, visit https://developer.apple.com/app-store/discoverability/.

**2\. Access to App Store Data**

You can access data concerning your Licensed Application’s financial performance and user engagement in App Store Connect by using App Analytics, Sales and Trends, and Payments and Financial Reports. Specifically, You can obtain all of Your Licensed Application’s financial results for individual app sales and in-app purchases (including subscriptions) in Sales and Trends, or download the data from Financial Reports; and You can view App Analytics for non-personally identifiable data that allows You to understand how consumers engage with your Licensed Applications. More information can be found at https://developer.apple.com/app-store/measuring-app-performance/. App Analytics data is provided only with the consent of our customers. For more information, see https://developer.apple.com/app-store-connect/analytics/. Apple does not provide You with access to personal or other data provided by or generated through use of the App Store by other developers; nor does Apple provide other developers with access to personal or other data provided by or generated through Your use of the App Store. Such data sharing would conflict with Apple’s Privacy Policy, and with our customers’ expectations about how Apple treats their data. You can seek to collect information from customers directly, so long as such information is collected in a lawful manner, and You follow the App Review Guidelines.

Apple handles personal and non-personal information as outlined in Apple’s Privacy Policy. Information about Apple’s access to and practices concerning developer and customer data can be found in “App Store & Privacy,” accessible at https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/app-store/. Apple may provide some non-personal information to strategic partners that work with Apple to provide our products and services, help Apple market to customers, and sell ads on Apple’s behalf to display in the App Store and Apple News and Stocks. Such partners are obligated to protect that information and may be located wherever Apple operates.

**3\. Redress Options Pursuant to P2B and DSA Regulations**

For Developers established in, and which offer goods or services to customers located in, the European Union and subject to the Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 October 2022 on a Single Market For Digital Services and amending Directive 2000/31/EC (the Digital Services Act or DSA), more information about redress options available to You in connection with action Apple took against You, for example termination of Your developer account or removal of Your app from the App Store, is available here: apple.com/legal/dsa/redress-options.

Developers established in, and which offer goods or services to customers located in, a region subject to a platform-to-business regulation (“P2B Regulation”), such as the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on promoting fairness and transparency for business users of online intermediation services may submit complaints pursuant to such P2B Regulation related to the following issues at https://developer.apple.com/contact/p2b/: (a) Apple’s alleged non-compliance with any obligations set forth in the P2B Regulation which affect You in the region in which you are established; (b) technological that affect You and relate directly to distribution of Your Licensed Application on the App Store in the region in which you are established; or (c) measures taken by or behavior of Apple that affect You and relate directly to distribution of Your Licensed Application on the App Store in the region in which you are established. Apple will consider and process such complaints and communicate the outcome to You.

For Developers established in, and which offer goods or services to customers located in, the European Union, Apple identifies the following panel of mediators with which Apple is willing to engage to attempt to reach an agreement with developers established in, and which offer goods or services to customers located in, the European Union on the settlement, out of court, of any disputes between Apple and You arising in relation to the provision of the App Store services concerned, including complaints that could not be resolved by means of our complaint-handling system:

#### 2\. Delivery of the Licensed Applications to Apple

**2.1** You will deliver to Apple, at Your sole expense, using the App Store Connect tool or other mechanism provided by Apple, the Licensed Applications, Licensed Application Information and associated metadata, in a format and manner prescribed by Apple, as required for the delivery of the Licensed Applications to End-Users in accordance with this Schedule 2. Metadata You deliver to Apple under this Schedule 2 will include: (i) the title and version number of each of the Licensed Applications; (ii) the regions You designate, in which You wish Apple to allow End-Users to download those Licensed Applications; (iii) any copyright or other intellectual property rights notices; (iv) Your privacy policy; (v) Your End-User license agreement (“EULA”), if any, in accordance with Section 4.2 of this Schedule 2; and (vi) any additional metadata set forth in the Documentation and/or the App Store Connect tool as may be updated from time to time, including metadata designed to enhance search and discovery of content on Apple-branded hardware.

**2.2** All Licensed Applications will be delivered by You to Apple using software tools, a secure FTP site address and/or such other delivery methods as prescribed by Apple.

**2.3** You hereby certify that all of the Licensed Applications You deliver to Apple under this Schedule 2 are authorized for export from the United States to each of the regions listed on Exhibit A, in accordance with the requirements of all applicable laws, including but not limited to the United States Export Administration Regulations, 15 C.F.R. Parts 730-774. You further represent and warrant that all versions of the Licensed Applications You deliver to Apple are not subject to the International Traffic In Arms Regulations 22 C.F.R. Parts 120-130 and are not designed, made, modified or configured for any military end users or end uses. Without limiting the generality of this Section 2.3, You certify that (i) none of the Licensed Applications contains, uses or supports any data encryption or cryptographic functions; or (ii) in the event that any Licensed Application contains, uses or supports any such data encryption or cryptographic functionality, You certify that You have complied with the United States Export Administration Regulations, and are in possession of, and will upon request provide Apple with, PDF copies of export classification ruling (CCATS) issued by the United States Commerce Department, Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) or any self-classification reports submitted to the BIS, and appropriate authorizations from other regions that mandate import authorizations for that Licensed Application, as required. You acknowledge that Apple is relying upon Your certification in this Section 2.3 in allowing End-Users to access and download the Licensed Applications under this Schedule 2. Except as provided in this Section 2.3, Apple will be responsible for compliance with the requirements of the Export Administration Regulations in allowing End-Users to access and download the Licensed Applications under this Schedule 2.

**2.4** You shall be responsible for determining and implementing any age ratings or parental advisory warnings required by the applicable government regulations, ratings board(s), service(s), or other organizations (each a “Ratings Board”) for any video, television, gaming or other content offered in Your Licensed Application for each locality in the Territory. Where applicable, You shall also be responsible for providing any content restriction tools or age verification functionality before enabling end-users to access mature or otherwise regulated content within Your Licensed Application.

#### 3\. Delivery of the Licensed Applications to End-Users

**3.1** You acknowledge and agree that Apple, in the course of acting as agent and/or commissionaire for You, is hosting, or pursuant to Section 1.2(b) of this Schedule 2 may enable authorized third parties to host, the Licensed Applications, and is allowing the download of those Licensed Applications by End-Users, on Your behalf. However, You are responsible for hosting and delivering content or services sold by You using the In-App Purchase API, except for content that is included within the Licensed Application itself (i.e., the In-App Purchase simply unlocks the content) or content hosted by Apple pursuant to section 3.3 of Attachment 2 to the Agreement. All of the Licensed Applications shall be marketed by Apple, on Your behalf, to End-Users at prices identified in a price tier and designated by You, in Your sole discretion, from the pricing schedule set forth in the App Store Connect tool, which may be updated from time to time by Apple. In addition, You may, at Your election via App Store Connect, instruct Apple to market the Licensed Applications at a discount of 50% of Your established price tier for authorized institutional customers. You may change the price tier for any Licensed Application at any time, at Your discretion, in accordance with the pricing schedule set forth in the App Store Connect tool as may be updated from time to time. As Your agent and/or commissionaire, Apple shall be solely responsible for the collection of all prices payable by End-Users for Licensed Applications acquired by those End-Users under this Schedule 2.

**3.2** In the event that the sale or delivery of any of the Licensed Applications to any End-User is subject to any sales, use, goods and services, value added, telecommunications or other similar tax or levy, under applicable law, responsibility for the collection and remittance of that tax for sales of the Licensed Applications to End-Users will be determined in accordance with Exhibit B to this Schedule 2 as updated from time to time via the App Store Connect site. You are solely responsible for selecting and maintaining accurate inputs for tax categorization for Your Licensed Applications via the App Store Connect site, which may be updated from time to time. Such tax categorization will be applied to the sale and delivery of Your Licensed Applications. Any adjustments that You make to the tax categorization for Your Licensed Applications will take effect for future sales of Licensed Applications after Apple has processed the adjustment within a reasonable period of time. Adjustments that You make to the tax categorization for Your Licensed Applications will not apply to any sales of Licensed Applications occurring before Apple has processed Your tax categorization adjustment.

If the tax categorization of Your Licensed Applications is deemed to be inaccurate by any tax authority, You are solely responsible for the tax consequences. If Apple deems in its reasonable discretion that the tax categorization of Your Licensed Applications is inaccurate, Apple reserves the right to hold in trust amounts owed to You, until such time as You correct the tax categorization. Upon correction of the tax categorization, Apple will deduct any penalties and interest resulting from the inaccuracy, and remit to You any remaining amounts held in trust by Apple for You, without interest, in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule 2. You shall indemnify and hold Apple harmless against any and all claims by any tax authority for any underpayment or overpayment of any sales, use, goods and services, value added, telecommunications or other tax or levy, and any penalties and/or interest thereon.

**3.3** In furtherance of the parties’ respective tax compliance obligations, Apple requires that You comply with the requirements listed on Exhibit C to this Schedule 2 or on App Store Connect depending upon, among other things, (i) Your region of residence and (ii) the regions designated by You in which You wish Apple to allow access to the Licensed Applications. In the event that Apple collects any amounts corresponding to the purchase price for any of Your Licensed Applications before You have provided Apple with any tax documentation required under Exhibit C to this Schedule 2, Apple may decide to not remit those amounts to You, and to hold those amounts in trust for You, until such time as You have provided Apple with the required tax documentation. Upon receipt of all required tax documents from You, Apple will remit to You any amounts held in trust by Apple for You, without interest, under this Section 3.3, in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule 2.

**3.4** Apple shall be entitled to the following commissions in consideration for its services as Your agent and/or commissionaire under this Schedule 2:

(a) For sales of Licensed Applications to End-Users, Apple shall be entitled to a commission equal to thirty percent (30%) of all prices payable by each End-User. Solely for auto-renewing subscription purchases made by customers who have accrued greater than one year of paid subscription service within a Subscription Group (as defined below) and notwithstanding any Retention Grace Periods or Renewal Extension Periods, Apple shall be entitled to a commission equal to fifteen percent (15%) of all prices payable by each End-User for each subsequent renewal. Retention Grace Period refers to the time period between the end of a customer’s subscription (e.g., due to cancelation or non-payment) and the beginning of a new subscription within the same Subscription Group, provided that such time period is no greater than 60 days, subject to change. Renewal Extension Period refers to the time by which You extend the renewal date of the customer’s subscription, without additional charges. For purposes of determining the commissions to which Apple is entitled under this Section 3.4(a), the prices payable by End-Users shall be net of any and all taxes collected, as provided in Section 3.2 of this Schedule 2.

(b) App Store Small Business Program. For Developers who have qualified and been approved by Apple for the App Store Small Business Program, Apple shall be entitled to a reduced commission of 15% of all prices payable by each End-User for sales of Licensed Applications to End-Users located in those regions listed in Exhibit B of this Schedule 2 as updated from time to time via the App Store Connect site. You may qualify for approval in the App Store Small Business Program subject to the terms of the Agreement, this Schedule 2, and the following:

You and Your Associated Developer Accounts must have earned no more than $1,000,000 in total proceeds (sales net of Apple’s commission and certain taxes and adjustments) during the twelve (12) fiscal months occurring in the prior calendar year (“calendar year”), as calculated by Apple under standard business practices.

To enroll in the App Store Small Business Program, You must provide Apple with any requested information related to You and Your Associated Developer Accounts. If there is a change in Your relationship to an Associated Developer Account, You must update such information. An “Associated Developer Account” is any Apple Developer Program account (i) You own or control or (ii) which owns or controls Your account. For example, as the individual or legal entity who accepted the terms of the Agreement and this Schedule 2, You have an Associated Developer Account if any of the following apply:

* You have majority (over 50%) corporate, individual, or partnership interest in the ownership or shares of another Apple Developer Program member account.
* Another Apple Developer Program member has majority (over 50%) corporate, individual, or partnership interest in the ownership or shares of Your account.
* You have ultimate decision-making authority over another Apple Developer Program member account.
* Another Apple Developer Program member has ultimate decision-making authority over Your account.

You and Your Associated Developer Accounts must be in good standing as members of the Apple Developer Program.

Once the total proceeds of You and Your Associated Developer Accounts exceeds $1,000,000 in the current calendar year, You will be charged the standard commission rate set forth in Section 3.4(a) in this Schedule 2 for the remainder of the calendar year.

Apple will determine eligibility and approve qualified Developers for participation in the App Store Small Business Program within fifteen (15) days of the end of each fiscal calendar month.

If the total proceeds of You and Your Associated Developer Accounts amount to no more than $1,000,000 in a future calendar year, You may re-qualify for approval in the App Store Small Business Program in the following calendar year.

If You participate, either as a Transferor or a Recipient (hereafter referred to as an “App Transfer Party”), in the transfer of a Licensed Application, the proceeds associated with that Licensed Application will be included in the calculation of total proceeds of any App Transfer Party to determine eligibility for participation in the App Store Small Business Program. For example, if You transfer a Licensed Application from Your developer account to another developer account using the App Store Connect tool, the proceeds associated with that transferred Licensed Application will be included in the calculation of Your total proceeds and in the calculation of the total proceeds of the developer account to which you transferred the Licensed Application. If a Licensed Application is transferred multiple times in a given calendar year, the proceeds associated with that Licensed Application will be included in the calculation of total proceeds of each and every App Transfer Party.

You and Your Associated Developer Accounts will be disqualified from the App Store Small Business Program and terminated at Apple’s discretion, if You or Your Associated Developer Accounts engage in any suspicious, misleading, fraudulent, improper, unlawful or dishonest act or omission relating to qualification in the App Store Small Business Program (e.g., providing false or inaccurate information to Apple, creating or using multiple Apple Developer Program accounts to improperly benefit from the App Store Small Business Program).

Apple may withhold payments due to You and Your Associated Developer Accounts for violations of this provision.

Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.2 of this Schedule 2, Apple shall be entitled to the commissions specified in Section 3.4 hereof without reduction for any taxes or other government levies, including any and all taxes or other, similar obligations of You, Apple or any End-User relating to the delivery or use of the Licensed Applications. For sales of Licensed Applications developed by Apple, Apple is not entitled to a commission.

**3.5** Upon collection of any amounts from any End-User as the price for any Licensed Application delivered to that End-User hereunder, Apple shall deduct the full amount of its commission with respect to that Licensed Application, and any taxes collected by Apple under Section 3.2 and 3.4 hereof, and shall remit to You, or issue a credit in Your favor, as the case may be, the remainder of those prices in accordance with Apple standard business practices, including the following: remittance payments (i) are made by means of wire transfer only; (ii) are subject to minimum monthly remittance amount thresholds; (iii) require You to provide certain remittance-related information on the App Store Connect site; and (iv) subject to the foregoing requirements, will be made no later than forty-five (45) days following the close of the monthly period in which the corresponding amount was received by Apple from the End-User. No later than forty-five (45) days following the end of each monthly period, Apple will make available to You on the App Store Connect site a sales report in sufficient detail to permit You to identify the Licensed Applications sold in that monthly period and the total amount to be remitted to You by Apple. You hereby acknowledge and agree that Apple shall be entitled to a commission, in accordance with this Section 3.5 on the delivery of any Licensed Application to any End-User, even if Apple is unable to collect the price for that Licensed Application from that End-User. In the event that the purchase price received by Apple from any End-User for any Licensed Application is in a currency other than the remittance currency agreed between Apple and You, the purchase price for that Licensed Application shall be converted to the remittance currency, and the amount to be remitted by Apple to You shall be determined, in accordance with an exchange rate fixed for the Delivery Period, as reflected in the App Store Connect tool as may be updated from time to time, pursuant to section 3.1 of this Schedule 2. Apple may provide a means on App Store Connect to enable You to designate a primary currency for the bank account designated by You for receiving remittances (“Designated Currency”). Apple may cause Apple’s bank to convert all remittances in any remittance currency other than the Designated Currency into the Designated Currency prior to remittance to You. You agree that any resulting currency exchange differentials or fees charged by Apple’s bank may be deducted from such remittances. You remain responsible for any fees (e.g., wire transfer fees) charged by Your bank or any intermediary banks between Your bank and Apple’s bank.

**3.6** In the event that Apple’s commission or any price payable by any End-User for any of the Licensed Applications is subject to (i) any withholding or similar tax; or (ii) any sales, use, goods and services, value added, telecommunications or other tax or levy not collected by Apple under Section 3.2 hereof; or (iii) any other tax or other government levy of whatever nature, the full amount of that tax or levy shall be solely for Your account, and shall not reduce the commission to which Apple is entitled under this Schedule 2.

**3.7** In the event that any remittance made by Apple to You is subject to any withholding or similar tax, the full amount of that withholding or similar tax shall be solely for Your account, and will not reduce the commission to which Apple is entitled on that transaction. If Apple reasonably believes that such tax is due, Apple will deduct the full amount of such withholding or similar tax from the gross amount owed to You, and will pay the full amount withheld over to the competent tax authorities. Apple will apply a reduced rate of withholding tax, if any, provided for in any applicable income tax treaty only if You furnish Apple with such documentation required under that income tax treaty or otherwise satisfactory to Apple, sufficient to establish Your entitlement to the benefit of that reduced rate of withholding tax. Upon Your timely request to Apple in writing, using means reasonably designated by Apple, Apple will use commercially practical efforts to report to You the amount of Apple’s payment of withholding or similar taxes to the competent tax authorities on Your behalf. You will indemnify and hold Apple harmless against any and all claims by any competent tax authority for any underpayment of any such withholding or similar taxes, and any penalties and/or interest thereon, including, but not limited to, underpayments attributable to any erroneous claim or representation by You as to Your entitlement to, or Your disqualification for, the benefit of a reduced rate of withholding tax.

**3.8** You may offer auto-renewing subscriptions in select Territories using the In-App Purchase API subject to the terms of this Schedule 2, provided that:

(a) Auto-renew functionality must be on a weekly, monthly, bi-monthly, tri-monthly, semi-annual or annual basis at prices You select in the App Store Connect tool. You may offer multiple durations and service levels for Your subscription and will have the ability to associate and rank these subscription items within Subscription Groups, to enable customers to easily upgrade, downgrade, and cross-grade amongst the Subscription Group options. You understand and agree that when a subscriber upgrades or cross-grades (except for cross-grades of different durations), such service level will begin immediately and Your proceeds will be adjusted accordingly, and when a subscriber downgrades, the new service will begin at the end of the current subscription period.

(b) You clearly and conspicuously disclose to users the following information regarding Your auto- renewing subscription:

* Title of auto-renewing subscription, which may be the same as the in-app product name
* Length of subscription
* Price of subscription, and price per unit if appropriate

Links to Your Privacy Policy and Terms of Use must be accessible within Your Licensed Application.

(c) You must fulfill the offer during the entire subscription period, as marketed, including any Billing Grace Period You authorize, and, in the event You breach this section 3.8(c) of Schedule 2, You hereby authorize and instruct Apple to refund to the End-User the full amount, or any portion thereof in Apple’s sole discretion, of the price paid by the End-User for that subscription. Billing Grace Period refers to the period during which Developers agree to provide paid service for free to users who do not recover from a billing error. In the event that Apple refunds any such price to an End-User, You shall reimburse, or grant Apple a credit for, an amount equal to the price for that subscription. You acknowledge that Apple may exercise its rights under section 7.3 of this Schedule 2 for repeated violations of this provision.

**3.9** When You make price changes to an existing subscription item, You may elect to retain current pricing for Your existing customers by indicating Your intent in the App Store Connect tool. When You increase pricing for existing subscribers in regions that require end-user consent, they will be prompted to review and agree to the new price, otherwise the auto-renewal feature will be disabled.

**3.10** To the extent You promote and offer for sale auto-renewing subscriptions, within or outside of Your Licensed Application, You must do so in compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements.

**3.11** Subscription services purchased within Licensed Applications must use In-App Purchase.

In addition to using the In-App Purchase API, a Licensed Application may read or play content (magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, video) that is offered outside of the Licensed Application (such as, by way of example, through Your website) provided that You do not link to or market external offers for such content within the Licensed Application. You are responsible for authentication access to content acquired outside of the Licensed Application.

**3.12** If Your Licensed Application is periodical content-based (e.g. magazines and newspapers), Apple may provide You with the name, email address, and zip code associated with an End-User’s account when they purchase an auto-renewing subscription via the In-App Purchase API, provided that such user consents to the provision of data to You, and further provided that You may only use such data to promote Your own products and do so in strict compliance with Your publicly posted Privacy Policy, a copy of which must be readily viewed and is consented to in Your Licensed Application. You may offer a free incentive to extend the subscription if the user agrees to send this information.

**3.13** You may use Subscription Offer Codes to promote your auto-renewing subscriptions in select Territories subject to the terms of the Agreement, this Schedule 2, and the following:

(a) Subscription Offer Code means a code provided by Apple to You, pursuant to these terms, which allows an End-User to whom You provide one or more Subscription Offer Codes to download or access Your Licensed Application.

(b) Upon request by You via the App Store Connect tool, Apple shall deliver the Subscription Offer Codes electronically to You. Subscription Offer Codes will become active for use by End-Users upon delivery to You.

You may not distribute Subscription Offer Codes that are no longer active to End-Users in any Territory in which You are not permitted to sell or distribute Your Licensed Application.

You shall not export any Subscription Offer Code for use outside the Territories nor represent that You have the right or ability to do so.

Risk of loss and transfer of title for the Subscription Offer Codes pass to You upon delivery to You.

You shall comply with all applicable laws in the Territories in which You distribute Subscription Offer Codes.

(c) Apple shall not be responsible for developing or producing any materials in relation to the Subscription Offer Codes other than the Subscription Offer Codes themselves.

You shall not sell the Subscription Offer Codes or accept any form of payment, trade-in-kind, or other compensation in connection with the distribution of the Subscription Offer Codes and You shall prohibit third parties from doing so.

During the period when a Subscription Offer Code allows an End-User to access a subscription in Your Licensed Application for free, You hereby waive any right to collect any royalties, proceeds, or remuneration for such access, regardless of whether any remuneration would otherwise be payable under the Agreement, this Schedule 2, and Schedule 1 thereto, if applicable. The parties acknowledge that, as between Apple and You, the parties’ respective responsibilities for the payment of any royalties or other similar payments to third parties with respect to End-Users accessing subscriptions in your Licensed Application via the Subscription Offer Codes shall be as set forth in the Agreement and this Schedule 2.

You shall be solely responsible for Your use of the Subscription Offer Codes, including any use by other members of Your App Store Connect team, and for any loss or liability to You or Apple therefrom.

In the event Your Licensed Application is removed from the App Store for any reason, You agree to cease distribution of all Subscription Offer Codes and that Apple may deactivate such Subscription Offer Codes.

You agree that Apple shall have the right to deactivate the Subscription Offer Codes, even if already delivered to End-Users, in the event You violate any of the terms in the Agreement or this Schedule 2.

(d) You must include the following Subscription Offer Code End-User terms in any instrument used to distribute the Subscription Offer Codes to End-Users (e.g., certificate, card, e-mail, coupons, online posts): (i) The code expiration date or while supplies last; (ii) The Territory in which the codes can be redeemed; (iii) Apple Account is required, subject to prior acceptance of license and usage terms; (iv) Codes are not for resale, and have no cash value; (v) Full terms apply; see https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/; and (vi) Offer and content are provided by You.

**3.14** Where available, You may offer multiple Licensed Applications offered by You in a single collection (“Bundle”) to End-Users at a price tier designated by You as set forth in the App Store Connect tool as may be updated from time to time. Furthermore, You hereby authorize and instruct Apple to enable users who have purchased some but not all Licensed Applications in a Bundle to access and download the remaining items in the Bundle (“Complete My Bundle” or “CMB”) for the CMB Price. You will receive proceeds for the CMB Price, which shall equal the Bundle Price set by You less the sum of the retail prices paid by the user for previously purchased Licensed Applications. In the event the CMB Price is less than Tier 1 and greater than zero under the price tiers set forth in the App Store Connect tool, You hereby authorize and instruct Apple to set the CMB Price for that user at Tier 1. In the event the CMB Price is less than zero, You hereby authorize and instruct Apple to provide the remaining Licensed Applications in the Bundle to the End-User without charge. Each CMB transaction will be reflected in Your statement as follows: (i) a new sale of the full Bundle at the price paid for the Bundle, identified as a CMB sale; and (ii) a return (i.e., a negative transaction) for each eligible purchased Licensed Application contained in the Bundle in the amount previously paid for the Licensed Application, each identified as a CMB return. Bundles offered at Tier 0 must offer an auto-renewing subscription service pursuant to Section 3.8 of this Schedule 2 in each Licensed Application included in the Bundle, and users who purchase such subscription service from within one app in the Bundle must be able to access that subscription service in each of the other Licensed Applications in the Bundle at no additional cost.

**5.4** Licensed Applications that are targeted at children or otherwise likely to appeal to children, and which pressure children to make purchases (including, but not limited to, phrases such as “buy now” or “upgrade now”) or persuade others to make purchases for them, should not be made available in any Territory that has deemed such marketing practices illegal. You expressly accept and agree to take full responsibility for Your Licensed Applications’ compliance with applicable laws pursuant to Section 5.1(c) of this Schedule 2, including without limitation consumer protection, marketing, and gaming laws.

#### 7\. Termination

**7.1** This Schedule 2, and all of Apple’s obligations hereunder, shall terminate upon the expiration or termination of the Agreement. Notwithstanding any such termination, Apple shall be entitled to: (i) all commissions on all copies of the Licensed Applications downloaded by End-Users prior to the date of termination (including the phase-out period set forth in Section 1.4 hereof); and (ii) reimbursement from You of refunds paid by Apple to End-Users, whether before or after the date of termination, in accordance with Section 6.3 of this Schedule 2. When the Agreement terminates, Apple may withhold all payments due to You for a period that Apple determines is reasonable in order to calculate and offset any End-User refunds. If at any time Apple determines or suspects that You or any developers with which You are affiliated have engaged in, or encouraged or participated with other developers to engage in, any suspicious, misleading, fraudulent, improper, unlawful or dishonest act or omission, Apple may withhold payments due to You or such other developers.

**7.2** In the event that You no longer have the legal right to distribute the Licensed Applications, or to authorize Apple to allow access to those Licensed Applications by End-Users, in accordance with this Schedule 2, You shall promptly notify Apple and withdraw those Licensed Applications from the App Store using the tools provided on the App Store Connect site; provided, however, that such withdrawal by You under this Section 7.2 shall not relieve You of any of Your obligations to Apple under this Schedule 2, or any liability to Apple and/or any End-User with respect to those Licensed Applications.

**7.3** Apple reserves the right to cease marketing, offering, and allowing download by End-Users of the Licensed Applications at any time, with or without cause, by providing notice of termination to You. Without limiting the generality of this Section 7.3, You acknowledge that Apple may cease the marketing and allowing download by End-Users of some or all of the Licensed Applications, or take other interim measures in Apple’s sole discretion, if Apple reasonably believes, based on human and/or systematic review, and, including without limitation upon notice received under applicable laws, that: (i) those Licensed Applications are not authorized for export to one or more of the regions listed on Exhibit A, in accordance with the Export Administration Regulations or other restrictions; (ii) those Licensed Applications and/or any End-User’s possession and/or use of those Licensed Applications, infringe patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property rights of any third party; (iii) the distribution, sale and/or use of those Licensed Applications violates any applicable law in any region You designated under Section 2.1 of this Schedule 2; (iv) You have violated the terms of the Agreement, this Schedule 2, or other documentation including without limitation the App Review Guidelines; (v) Your Licensed Applications violate Section 5.4 of this Schedule 2, including without limitation upon notice by a regulator of an alleged violation; or (vi) You or anyone representing You or Your company are subject to sanctions of any region in which Apple operates. An election by Apple to cease the marketing and allowing download of any Licensed Applications, pursuant to this Section 7.3, shall not relieve You of Your obligations under this Schedule 2.

**7.4** You may withdraw any or all of the Licensed Applications from the App Store, at any time, and for any reason, by using the tools provided on the App Store Connect site, except that, with respect to Your End- Users, You hereby authorize and instruct Apple to fulfill sections 1.2(b), (c), and (d) of this Schedule 2, which shall survive termination or expiration of the Agreement unless You indicate otherwise pursuant to sections 5.1 and 7.2 of this Schedule 2.

#### 8\. Legal Consequences

#### 3\. Delivery of the Custom Applications to End-Users

**3.1** You acknowledge and agree that Apple, in the course of acting as agent and/or commissionaire for You, is hosting the Custom Applications, providing Content Codes to Custom App Distribution Customers, and is allowing the download of the Custom Applications by End-Users, on Your behalf. However, You are responsible for hosting and delivering content or services sold by You using the In-App Purchase API, except for content that is included within the Custom Application itself (i.e., the In-App Purchase simply unlocks the content) or content hosted by Apple pursuant to Section 3.3 of the Program Agreement. All of the Custom Applications shall be marketed by Apple, on Your behalf, to End-User Custom App Distribution Customers at prices identified in a price tier and designated by You, in Your sole discretion, from the pricing schedule set forth in the App Store Connect tool, which may be updated from time to time by Apple. You may change the price tier for any Custom Application at any time, at Your discretion, in accordance with the pricing schedule set forth in the App Store Connect tool. As Your agent and/or commissionaire, Apple shall be solely responsible for the collection of all prices payable by Custom App Distribution Customers for Custom Applications acquired by End-Users under this Schedule 3.

**3.2** In the event that the sale or delivery of any of the Custom Applications to any End-User is subject to any sales, use, goods and services, value added, telecommunications or other similar tax or levy, under applicable law, responsibility for the collection and remittance of that tax for sales of the Custom Applications to End-Users will be determined in accordance with Exhibit B to this Schedule 3 as updated from time to time via the App Store Connect site. You are solely responsible for selecting and maintaining accurate inputs for tax categorization for Your Custom Applications via the App Store Connect site, which may be updated from time to time. Such tax categorization will be applied to the sale and delivery of Your Custom Applications. Any adjustments that You make to the tax categorization for Your Custom Applications will take effect for future sales of Custom Applications after Apple has processed the adjustment within a reasonable period of time. Adjustments that You make to the tax categorization for Your Custom Applications will not apply to any sales of Custom Applications occurring before Apple has processed Your tax categorization adjustment.

If the tax categorization of Your Custom Applications is deemed to be inaccurate by any tax authority, You are solely responsible for the tax consequences. If Apple deems in its reasonable discretion that the tax categorization of Your Custom Applications is inaccurate, Apple reserves the right to hold in trust amounts owed to You, until such time as You correct the tax categorization. Upon correction of the tax categorization, Apple will deduct any penalties and interest resulting from the inaccuracy, and remit to You any remaining amounts held in trust by Apple for You, without interest, in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule 3. You shall indemnify and hold Apple harmless against any and all claims by any tax authority for any underpayment or overpayment of any sales, use, goods and services, value added, telecommunications or other tax or levy, and any penalties and/or interest thereon.

**3.3** In furtherance of the parties’ respective tax compliance obligations, Apple requires that You comply with the requirements listed on Exhibit C to this Schedule 3 or on App Store Connect depending upon, among other things, (i) Your region of residence, and (ii) the regions designated by You in which You wish Apple to allow sale of and access to the Custom Applications. In the event that Apple collects any amounts corresponding to the purchase price for any of Your Custom Applications before You have provided Apple with any tax documentation required under Exhibit C to this Schedule 3, Apple may decide to not remit those amounts to You, and to hold those amounts in trust for You, until such time as You have provided Apple with the required tax documentation. Upon receipt of all required tax documents from You, Apple will remit to You any amounts held in trust by Apple for You, without interest, under this Section 3.3, in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule 3.

**3.4** Apple shall be entitled to the following commissions in consideration for its services as Your agent and/or commissionaire under this Schedule 3:

For sales of Custom Applications to Custom App Distribution Customers, Apple shall be entitled to a commission equal to thirty percent (30%) of all prices payable by each Custom App Distribution Customer. Solely for auto-renewing subscription purchases made by customers who have accrued greater than one year of paid subscription service within a Subscription Group (as defined below) and notwithstanding any Retention Grace Periods or Renewal Extension Periods, Apple shall be entitled to a commission equal to fifteen percent (15%) of all prices payable by each End-User for each subsequent renewal. Retention Grace Period refers to the time period between the end of a customer’s subscription (e.g. due to cancelation or non-payment) and the beginning of a new subscription within the same Subscription Group, provided that such time period is no greater than 60 days, subject to change. Renewal Extension Period refers to the time by which You extend the renewal date of the customer’s subscription, without additional charges. For purposes of determining the commissions to which Apple is entitled under this Section 3.4, the prices payable by Custom App Distribution Customers shall be net of any and all taxes collected, as provided in Section 3.2 of this Schedule 3.

Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.2 of this Schedule 3, Apple shall be entitled to the commissions specified in Section 3.4 hereof without reduction for any taxes or other government levies, including any and all taxes or other, similar obligations of You, Apple or any Custom App Distribution Customer relating to the delivery or use of the Custom Applications. For sales of Licensed Applications and/or Custom Applications developed by Apple, Apple is not entitled to a commission.

**3.5** Upon collection of any amounts from any Custom App Distribution Customer as the price for any Custom Application delivered to that Custom App Distribution Customer’s designated End-Users hereunder, Apple shall deduct the full amount of its commission with respect to that Custom Application, and any taxes collected by Apple under Section 3.2 and 3.4 hereof, and shall remit to You, or issue a credit in Your favor, as the case may be, the remainder of those prices in accordance with Apple standard business practices, including the following: remittance payments (i) are made by means of wire transfer only; (ii) are subject to minimum monthly remittance amount thresholds; (iii) require You to provide certain remittance-related information on the App Store Connect site; and (iv) subject to the foregoing requirements, will be made no later than forty-five (45) days following the close of the monthly period in which the corresponding amount was received by Apple from the End-User. No later than forty-five (45) days following the end of each monthly period, Apple will make available to You on the App Store Connect site a sales report in sufficient detail to permit You to identify the Custom Applications sold in that monthly period and the total amount to be remitted to You by Apple. You hereby acknowledge and agree that Apple shall be entitled to a commission, in accordance with this Section 3.5 on the delivery of any Content Codes to any Custom App Distribution Customer, even if Apple is unable to collect the price for that Custom Application from the Custom App Distribution Customer. In the event that the purchase price received by Apple from any Custom App Distribution Customer for any Custom Application is in a currency other than the remittance currency agreed between Apple and You, the purchase price for that Custom Application shall be converted to the remittance currency, and the amount to be remitted by Apple to You shall be determined, in accordance with an exchange rate fixed for the Delivery Period, as reflected in the App Store Connect tool, as may be updated from time to time, pursuant to section 3.1 of this Schedule 3. Apple may provide a means on App Store Connect to enable You to designate a primary currency for the bank account designated by You for receiving remittances (“Designated Currency”). Apple may cause Apple’s bank to convert all remittances in any remittance currency other than the Designated Currency into the Designated Currency prior to remittance to You. You agree that any resulting currency exchange differentials or fees charged by Apple’s bank may be deducted from such remittances. You remain responsible for any fees (e.g., wire transfer fees) charged by Your bank or any intermediary banks between Your bank and Apple’s bank.

**3.6** In the event that Apple’s commission or any price payable by any Custom App Distribution Customer for any of the Custom Applications is subject to (i) any withholding or similar tax; or (ii) any sales, use, goods and services, value added, telecommunications or other tax or levy not collected by Apple under Section 3.2 hereof; or (iii) any other tax or other government levy of whatever nature, the full amount of that tax or levy shall be solely for Your account, and shall not reduce the commission to which Apple is entitled under this Schedule 3.

**3.7** In the event that any remittance made by Apple to You is subject to any withholding or similar tax, the full amount of that withholding or similar tax shall be solely for Your account, and will not reduce the commission to which Apple is entitled on that transaction. If Apple reasonably believes that such tax is due, Apple will deduct the full amount of such withholding or similar tax from the gross amount owed to You, and will pay the full amount withheld over to the competent tax authorities. Apple will apply a reduced rate of withholding tax, if any, provided for in any applicable income tax treaty only if You furnish Apple with such documentation required under that income tax treaty or otherwise satisfactory to Apple, sufficient to establish Your entitlement to the benefit of that reduced rate of withholding tax. Upon Your timely request to Apple in writing, using means reasonably designated by Apple, Apple will use commercially practical efforts to report to You the amount of Apple’s payment of withholding or similar taxes to the competent tax authorities on Your behalf. You will indemnify and hold Apple harmless against any and all claims by any competent tax authority for any underpayment of any such withholding or similar taxes, and any penalties and/or interest thereon, including, but not limited to, underpayments attributable to any erroneous claim or representation by You as to Your entitlement to, or Your disqualification for, the benefit of a reduced rate of withholding tax.

**3.8** You may offer auto-renewing subscriptions in select Territories using the In-App Purchase API subject to the terms of this Schedule 3, provided that:

(a) Auto-renew functionality must be on a weekly, monthly, bi-monthly, tri-monthly, semi-annual, or annual basis at prices You select in the App Store Connect tool. You may, however, offer more than one option.

(b) You clearly and conspicuously disclose to users the following information regarding Your auto- renewing subscription:

* Title of auto-renewing subscription, which may be the same as the in-app product name
* Length of subscription
* Price of subscription, and price per unit if appropriate

Links to Your Privacy Policy and Terms of Use must be accessible within Your Licensed Application or Custom Application.

(c) You must fulfill the offer during the entire subscription period, as marketed, including any Billing Grace period You authorize, and, in the event You breach this section 3.8(c) of Schedule 3, You hereby authorize and instruct Apple to refund to the End-User the full amount, or any portion thereof in Apple’s sole discretion, of the price paid by the End-User for that subscription. Billing Grace Period refers to the period during which Developers agree to provide paid service for free to users who do not recover from a billing error. In the event that Apple refunds any such price to an End-User, You shall reimburse, or grant Apple a credit for, an amount equal to the price for that subscription. You acknowledge that Apple may exercise its rights under section 7.3 of this Schedule 3 for repeated violations of this provision.

**3.9** When You make price changes to an existing subscription item, You may elect to retain current pricing for Your existing customers by indicating Your intent in the App Store Connect tool. When You increase pricing for existing subscribers in regions that require end-user consent, they will be prompted to review and agree to the new price, otherwise the auto-renewal feature will be disabled.

**3.10** To the extent You promote and offer for sale auto-renewing subscriptions within or outside of Your Custom Application, You must do so in compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements.

**3.11** Subscription services purchased within Custom Applications must use In-App Purchase, which will be charged to the End-User iTunes account, not the Custom App Distribution Customer account.

In addition to using the In-App Purchase API, a Custom Application may read or play content (magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, video) that is offered outside of the Custom Application (such as, by way of example, through Your website) provided that You do not link to or market external offers for such content within the Custom Application. You are responsible for authentication access to content acquired outside of the Custom Application.

**3.12** If Your Custom Application is periodical content-based (e.g. magazines and newspapers), Apple may provide You with the name, email address, and zip code associated with an End-User’s account when they purchase an auto-renewing subscription via the In-App Purchase API, provided that such user consents to the provision of data to You, and further provided that You may only use such data to promote Your own products and otherwise in strict compliance with Your publicly posted Privacy Policy, a copy of which must be readily viewed through and is consented to in Your Custom Application. You may offer a free incentive to extend the subscription if the user agrees to send this information.

#### 4\. Ownership and End-User Licensing

**4.1** The parties acknowledge and agree that Apple shall not acquire any ownership interest in or to any of the Custom Applications or Licensed Application Information, and title, risk of loss, responsibility for, and control over the Custom Applications shall, at all times, remain with You. Apple may not use any of the Custom Applications or Licensed Application Information for any purpose, or in any manner, except as specifically authorized in this Schedule 3.

**4.2** You may deliver to Apple Your own EULA for any Custom Application at the time that You deliver that Custom Application to Apple, in accordance with Section 2.1 of this Schedule 3; provided, however, that Your EULA must include and may not be inconsistent with the minimum terms and conditions specified on Exhibit D to this Schedule 3, and must comply with all applicable laws in the United States. Apple shall allow each End- User to which Apple allows access to any such Custom Application to review Your EULA (if any) at the time that Apple delivers that Custom Application to that End-User, and Apple shall notify each End-User that the End-User’s use of that Custom Application is subject to the terms and conditions of Your EULA (if any). In the event that You do not furnish Your own EULA for any Custom Application to Apple, You acknowledge and agree that each End-User’s use of that Custom Application shall be subject to Apple’s standard EULA (which is part of the App Store Terms of Service).

**4.3** You hereby acknowledge that the EULA for each of the Custom Applications is solely between You and the End-User and conforms to applicable law, and Apple shall not be responsible for, and shall not have any liability whatsoever under, any EULA or any breach by You or any End-User of any of the terms and conditions of any EULA.

#### 5\. Content Restrictions and Software Rating

**5.1** You represent and warrant that: (a) You have the right to enter into this Agreement, to reproduce and distribute each of the Custom Applications, and to authorize Apple to permit End-Users to download and use each of the Custom Applications through the Custom App Distribution Site; (b) none of the Custom Applications, or Apple’s or End-Users’ permitted uses of those Custom Applications, violate or infringe any patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property or contractual rights of any other person, firm, corporation or other entity and that You are not submitting the Custom Applications to Apple on behalf of one or more third parties other than under license grant from one or more Custom App Distribution Customers; (c) each of the Custom Applications is authorized for distribution, sale and use in, export to, and import into each of the regions designated by You pursuant to Section 2.1 of this Schedule 3, in accordance with the laws and regulations of those regions and all applicable export/import regulations; (d) none of the Custom Applications contains any obscene, offensive or other materials that are prohibited or restricted under the laws or regulations of any of the regions You designated pursuant to Section 2.1 of this Schedule 3; (e) all information You provided using the App Store Connect tool, including any information relating to the Custom Applications, is accurate and that, if any such information ceases to be accurate, You will promptly update it to be accurate using the App Store Connect tool; and (f) in the event a dispute arises over the content of Your Custom Applications or use of Your intellectual property in connection with the Custom App Distribution Site, You agree to permit Apple to share Your contact information with the party filing such dispute and to follow Apple’s app dispute process on a non-exclusive basis and without any party waiving its legal rights.

**5.2** You shall use the software rating tool set forth on App Store Connect to supply information regarding each of the Custom Applications delivered by You for marketing and fulfillment by Apple through the Custom App Distribution Site under this Schedule 3 in order to assign a rating to each such Custom Application. For purposes of assigning a rating to each of the Custom Applications, You shall use Your best efforts to provide correct and complete information about the content of that Custom Application with the software rating tool. You acknowledge and agree that Apple is relying on: (i) Your good faith and diligence in accurately and completely providing requested information for each Custom Application; and (ii) Your representations and warranties in Section 5.1 hereof, in making that Custom Application available for download by End-Users in each of the regions You designated hereunder. Furthermore, You authorize Apple to correct the rating of any Custom Application of Yours that has been assigned an incorrect rating; and You agree to any such corrected rating.

**5.3** In the event that any region You designated hereunder requires the approval of, or rating of, any Custom Application by any government or industry regulatory agency as a condition for the distribution, sale and/or use of that Custom Application, You acknowledge and agree that Apple may elect not to make that Custom Application available for purchase by Custom App Distribution Customers and/or download by End- Users in that region from the Custom App Distribution Site.

**5.4** Custom Applications that are targeted at children or otherwise likely to appeal to children, and which pressure children to make purchases (including, but not limited to, phrases such as “buy now” or “upgrade now”) or persuade others to make purchases for them, should not be made available in any Territory that has deemed such marketing practices illegal. You expressly accept and agree to take full responsibility for Your Custom Applications’ compliance with applicable laws pursuant to Section 5.1(c) of this Schedule 3, including without limitation consumer protection, marketing, and gaming laws. For more information on legal requirements of regions in the European Union, see https://ec.europa.eu/justice/consumer-marketing/unfairtrade/index\_en.htm.

#### 6\. Responsibility and Liability

**6.2** You shall be solely responsible for, and Apple shall have no responsibility or liability whatsoever with respect to, any and all claims, suits, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses arising from, or attributable to, the Custom Applications and/or the use of those Custom Applications by any End-User, including, but not limited to: (i) claims of breach of warranty, whether specified in the EULA or established under applicable law; (ii) product liability claims; and (iii) claims that any of the Custom Applications and/or the End-User’s possession or use of those Custom Applications infringes the copyright or other intellectual property rights of any third party.

**6.3** In the event that Apple receives any notice or claim from any End-User that: (i) the End-User wishes to cancel its license to any of the Custom Applications within ninety (90) days of the date of download of that Custom Application by that End-User or the end of the auto-renewing subscription period offered pursuant to section 3.8 if such period is less than ninety (90) days; or (ii) a Custom Application fails to conform to Your specifications or Your product warranty or the requirements of any applicable law, Apple may refund to the Custom App Distribution Customer and/or End-User, as applicable, the full amount of the price paid by the Custom App Distribution Customer or End-User for that Custom Application. In the event that Apple refunds any such price to an End-User, You shall reimburse, or grant Apple a credit for, an amount equal to the price for that Custom Application. In the event that Apple receives any notice or claim from a payment provider that an End-User has obtained a refund for a Custom Application, You shall reimburse, or grant Apple a credit for, an amount equal to the price for that Custom Application.

#### 7\. Termination

**7.1** This Schedule 3, and all of Apple’s obligations hereunder, shall terminate upon the expiration or termination of the Agreement. Notwithstanding any such termination, Apple shall be entitled to: (i) all commissions on all Content Codes redeemable for copies of the Custom Applications provided to Custom App Distribution Customers prior to the date of termination (including the phase-out period set forth in Section 1.4 hereof); and (ii) reimbursement from You of refunds paid by Apple to Custom App Distribution Customers and/or End-Users, whether before or after the date of termination, in accordance with Section 6.3 of this Schedule 3. When the Agreement terminates, Apple may withhold all payments due to You for a period that Apple determines is reasonable in order to calculate and offset any Custom App Distribution Customer and/or End-User refunds. If at any time Apple determines or suspects that You or any developers with which You are affiliated have engaged in, or encouraged or participated with other developers to engage in, any suspicious, misleading, fraudulent, improper, unlawful or dishonest act or omission, Apple may withhold payments due to You or such other developers.

**7.2** In the event that You no longer have the legal right to distribute the Custom Applications, or to authorize Apple to allow access to those Custom Applications by End-Users, in accordance with this Schedule 3, You shall promptly notify Apple and withdraw those Custom Applications from the Custom App Distribution Site using the tools provided on the App Store Connect tool; provided, however, that such withdrawal by You under this Section 7.2 shall not relieve You of any of Your obligations to Apple under this Schedule 3, or any liability to Apple and/or any End-User with respect to those Custom Applications.

**7.3** Apple reserves the right to cease marketing, offering, and allowing purchase by Custom App Distribution Customers and download by End-Users of the Custom Applications at any time, with or without cause, by providing notice of termination to You. Without limiting the generality of this Section 7.3, You acknowledge that Apple may cease the marketing and allowing download by End-Users of some or all of the Custom Applications if Apple reasonably believes, based on human and/or systematic review, and, including without limitation upon notice received under applicable laws, that: (i) those Custom Applications are not authorized for export to one or more of the regions listed on Exhibit A, in accordance with the Export Administration Regulations or other restrictions; (ii) those Custom Applications and/or any End-User’s possession and/or use of those Custom Applications, infringe patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property rights of any third party; (iii) the distribution, sale and/or use of those Custom Applications violates any applicable law in any region You designated pursuant to Section 2.1 of this Schedule 3; (iv) You have violated the terms of the Agreement, this Schedule 3, or other documentation including without limitation the App Review Guidelines; (v) Your Custom Applications violate Section 5.4 of this Schedule 3, including without limitation upon notice by a regulator of an alleged violation; or (vi) You or anyone representing You or Your company are subject to sanctions of any region in which Apple operates. An election by Apple to cease the marketing and allowing download of any Custom Applications, pursuant to this Section 7.3, shall not relieve You of Your obligations under this Schedule 3.

**7.4** You may withdraw any or all of the Custom Applications from the Custom App Distribution Site, at any time, and for any reason, by using the tools provided on the App Store Connect site, except that, with respect to Your End-Users, You hereby authorize and instruct Apple to fulfill any outstanding Content Code redemption requests by End-Users and to fulfill sections 1.2(b), (c), and (d) of this Schedule 3, which shall survive termination or expiration of the Agreement unless You indicate otherwise pursuant to sections 5.1 and 7.2 of this Schedule 3.

The Collecting Entity will use commercially practical efforts to issue the respective withholding tax forms, which will be provided to You by Apple as provided in the Brazilian tax law. You are solely responsible for providing any additional documentation required by the tax authorities in Your region to be able to claim any foreign tax credits, if applicable.

The Collecting Entity will apply a reduced rate of withholding tax, if any, as provided in the applicable income tax treaty between Your region of residence and Brazil, only after You furnish Apple with the documentation as required under that income tax treaty or otherwise satisfactory to Apple, which is sufficient to establish Your entitlement to that reduced rate of withholding tax. You acknowledge that the reduced rate will only take effect after Apple approves and accepts the tax residence certificate or equivalent documentation provided by You. Notwithstanding section 3.3 of Schedule 2 and section 3.3 of Schedule 3, if Your funds will be remitted out of Brazil prior to receipt and approval by Apple of such tax documentation, the Collecting Entity may withhold and remit to the competent tax authorities the full amount of withholding tax unreduced by any tax treaty, and Apple will not refund to You any amount of such taxes withheld and remitted.

You will indemnify and hold Apple and the Collecting Entity harmless against any and all claims by any competent tax authority for any underpayment of any such withholding or similar taxes, and any penalties and/or interest thereon, including, but not limited to, underpayments attributable to any erroneous claim or representation by You as to Your entitlement to, or Your actual disqualification for, the benefit of a reduced rate of withholding tax.
