LinkedIn will serve your Postings as inventory becomes available on the Properties.\\n\\nYou are responsible for any activity conducted through your account, including any purchases made or charges incurred. ',\n 'If you identify that you are using the Jobs Services on behalf of a business, you agree that LinkedIn may share information about your purchases and use of the Jobs Services with that business, including its representatives and agents. If that business indicates that you are no longer authorized to place ads on its behalf (e.g., if you leave that business or changes roles within that business), you agree you may be removed from accounts associated with that business. You may not resell or transf',\n 'er access to the Jobs Services to any other party.\\n\\nEach Posting must be for one (1) job opportunity; it is not permitted for a Posting to solicit applications for more than one position.\\n\\nWithout limiting the prohibitions in the User Agreement or any other applicable agreement, you agree that you will not, and you will not enable or authorize any third party, by virtue of the Postings, Destinations, or use of the Jobs Services, to:\\n\\n* Create Postings without a reasonable and legitimate intent t',\n 'o hire for a bona fide job opportunity or the specific position listed.\\n* Create Postings that intentionally misrepresent the job, hiring company, or poster.\\n* Fail to clearly disclose in any Posting that a position is for an independent contractor or is part-time, piecework, commission-based, or has otherwise nontraditional working conditions or compensation may constitute intentional misrepresentation.\\n* Create Postings for “business opportunities” that require payments or recruitment of other',\n 's or that resemble franchises, multi-level marketing, club memberships, distributorships, or are entirely or almost entirely commission-based.\\n* Provide identifiable candidate resume or application data to any other parties.\\n* “Spam” or otherwise contact applicants for purposes other than related to the specific employment opportunity described in the posting.\\n* Harass, stalk, or contact any applicant after they have asked not to be contacted.\\n* Create Postings in the United States without posse',\n 'ssing valid Federal or State Employer Identification Numbers, if applicable, or create Postings in any other location in a manner that would not allow compliance with applicable tax and employment laws.\\n* Create Postings for jobs that require applicants to pay for employment or otherwise bear costs related to employment in violation of applicable law.\\n* Soliciting employees by intentional misrepresentation.\\n* Create Postings, advertise employment positions, or otherwise engage in recruitment or ',\n 'hiring practices that would be a violation of the law in your state or country, the state or country where the job is to be performed, or the state of California.\\n* Engage in solicitations, communications or transactions that violate any applicable laws or regulations related to the prohibition of employment discrimination, or that violate applicable laws governing legal eligibility to work.\\n* Engage in illegal or fraudulent conduct.\\n* Except as expressly authorized by LinkedIn in writing, use a',\n 'ny automated means or form of scraping or data extraction to access, modify, download, query or otherwise collect information from the Properties.\\n* Except as expressly authorized by LinkedIn in writing, copy, modify or create derivative works of the Jobs Services or any related technology.\\n* Create Postings that contain malware, spyware or any other malicious code or otherwise interfere with the operation of the Jobs Services or any device or system or breach or circumvent any security measure ',\n 'of LinkedIn or a third party.\\n\\nLinkedIn may, in its sole discretion, modify, or terminate any part or all of the Jobs Services or suspend your ability to use the Jobs Services.

Under AAA Rules, the arbitrator rules on his or he',\n 'r own jurisdiction, including ruling on disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, or the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement.\\xa0\\xa0But a court has exclusive authority to enforce the prohibition on arbitration on a class-wide basis or in a representative capacity, and to enjoin any arbitration proceedings that don’t comply with this Agreement.\\n\\n**11.6\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Arbitration fees and payments.**\\n\\n**Disputes in',\n 'volving $75,000 USD or less.** Provided that you’ve sent us an individualized Notice of Dispute with the information listed in Section 11.3 above and tried to resolve the dispute informally for 60 days, we will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.\\xa0However, if the arbitrator finds that your claim is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), we will no longer pay your sh',\n 'are of any fees or expenses, and the arbitrator may order you to reimburse us for any portion of your share of fees and expenses that we’ve already paid.\\n\\n**Disputes involving more than $75,000 USD.** The AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.\\xa0But the arbitrator may order us to pay some or all of your share of AAA’s and the arbitrator’s fees and expenses if you can’t afford to pay them.\\n\\n**11.7\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Procedures for related cases.**\\n\\nIf your Not',\n 'ice of Dispute involves claims similar to at least 24 other customers, and if you and those other customers are represented by the same lawyers or lawyers who are coordinating with each other, you and we agree that these claims will be considered “Related Cases.” Related Cases may only be filed in batches of up to 20 arbitrations at a time, and those arbitrations will be resolved in the manner described below.\\xa0\\n\\nFor the first batch, each side may select up to 10 of these Related Cases to be file',\n 'd and resolved individually in arbitrations as outlined in this Section 11. The batch consists of the Related Cases selected by each side.\\xa0None of the other Related Cases may be filed in arbitration until the first batch of cases is resolved. If, after the first batch of cases is resolved, the parties are unable to informally resolve the remaining Related Cases, a second batch of Related Cases may be filed, where each side may select up to 10 of the Related Cases to be resolved individually in a',\n 'rbitrations as outlined above in Section 11. This process of batched arbitrations will continue until the parties are able to resolve all of the claims either informally or through individual arbitrations.\\xa0Statutes of limitations and other time-based defenses will be tolled following our receipt of your individualized Notice of Dispute with the information listed in Section 11.3 above as long as a Related Case to your individualized Notice of Dispute is pending.\\n\\nThe arbitrator may consider ruli',\n 'ngs in other arbitrations involving different claimants, but an arbitrator’s ruling will not be binding in proceedings involving different claimants.\\n\\nThe procedures above supersede and replace the AAA’s Supplemental Rules for Multiple Case Filings (and any similar rules the AAA may adopt), which will not apply to arbitrations filed under this Agreement.\\xa0A court will have the exclusive authority to enforce Section 11.7, including the question whether Section 11.7 applies to a given set of cases ',\n 'and the ability to prevent the filing or prosecution of arbitrations that do not comply with the process outlined in Section 11.7.\\n\\n**11.8\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The applicability of this Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver, and your option to opt out of it.**\\n\\nThis Agreement goes into effect between you and LinkedIn as soon as you launch a campaign, run an ad on the Advertising Platform, access our Campaign Manager tool, or otherwise register for, access, or use our Ad Services on any of our properties.\\xa0',\n 'It governs all disputes described in Section 11.1 above, except that it doesn’t require you to arbitrate cases that are already pending in court when this Agreement goes into effect.\\xa0If a class action is already pending in court when this Agreement goes into effect and the court in that proceeding certifies a class that includes you, you may participate in the class if you wish to.\\xa0But unless you opt out of this Section 11 as provided below, you may not bring or participate in any other class ac',\n 'tion against us.\\n\\nYou may opt out of this Section 11 by sending us a notice by email to [ArbitrationOptOut@linkedin.com](mailto:ArbitrationOptOut@linkedin.com) within 30 days after this Agreement goes into effect.

IF YOU ARE CONTRACTING WITH SNAP INC., THEN YOU AND SNAP INC. WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n------------\\n\\nThese Business Services Terms form a legally binding contrac',\n 't between Snap and the individual agreeing to these Business Services Terms and any entity on whose behalf that individual is acting (“you”) and govern the use of Snap’s business products and services (“Business Services”). These Business Services Terms incorporate by reference the\\xa0[Snap Terms of Service](https://snap.com/en-US/terms/)\\xa0and Supplemental Terms and Policies. The Business Services are “Services” as defined in the\\xa0[Snap Terms of Service](https://snap.com/en-US/terms).\\n\\n1\\\\. Contractin',\n 'g Entity; Accounts\\n--------------------------------\\n\\na. The Snap entity you contract with depends on where you live (for an individual) or where your entity’s principal place of business is located. For an individual using the Business Services in her or his personal capacity, “Snap” means Snap Inc. if the individual lives in the United States and Snap Group Limited if the individual lives outside the United States. If the individual is using the Business Services on behalf of an entity, then “S',\n 'nap” means Snap Inc. if that entity’s principal place of business is in the United States and Snap Group Limited if that entity’s principal place of business is outside the United States, in each case, even if that entity is acting as agent for another entity somewhere else. However, if the [Local Terms](https://snap.com/en-US/terms/local) specify a different entity based on the specific Business Services you are using, then “Snap” means the entity specified in the [Local Terms](https://snap.com',\n '/en-US/terms/local).\\n\\nb. You may be required to create and maintain an account and sub-accounts to use the Business Services. You are responsible for setting and revoking the access levels for your accounts, for providing and updating any information that Snap reasonably requests, including up-to-date email addresses for each member of your accounts, and for all activity that occurs in your accounts. If you are authorized to access a third-party account, you must comply with these Business Servi',\n 'ces Terms when you access that party’s account.\\n\\n_In summary: The Snap entity you are entering into a contract with will depend on your principal place of business. You are responsible for keeping your Business Services account details up to date and for any activity that occurs in your accounts._\\n\\n2\\\\. Restrictions\\n----------------\\n\\na. In addition to the restrictions under the\\xa0[Snap Terms of Service](https://snap.com/en-US/terms), you will not, and will not authorize, encourage, or allow any oth',\n 'er party to: (i) use or combine the Services with software offered under an open-source license that creates obligations with respect to the Services contrary to these Business Services Terms, or purports to grant to any third party any rights to, or immunities under, Snap’s intellectual property or proprietary rights in the Services; (ii) gather, access, or otherwise process any personal data via the Services for any purpose without Snap’s prior written consent; (iii) transmit any \"back door,” ',\n '“time bomb,” “Trojan Horse,” “worm,” “drop dead device,” “virus,” “spyware,” or “malware,” or any computer code or software routine, which permits unauthorized access to, disables, damages, erases, disrupts, or impairs the normal operation of, or use of the Services, or any products or services provided by a third party in connection with the Services; or (iv) sell, resell, rent, lease, transfer, license, sublicense, syndicate, lend, or provide access to (except to individuals you authorize to a',\n 'ccess and use your accounts) the Services, without Snap’s express prior written approval.

All content unlocked via Snapcode must be appropriate for people ages 13+.

Snap and its affiliates may use a Snapcode and content unlocked via Snapcode for advertising, marketing, and promotional purposes. For purposes of these Business Services Terms, “Snapcode,” means a scannable code Snap or its affiliates provide to you that users can scan to access co',\n 'ntent.\\xa0\\n\\nd. If you use a Snapcode, ad, or any other content, data, or information relating to your use of the Business Services as part of a a sweepstakes, contest, offer, or other promotion including those generated or made available via the Services (“Promotion”), you are solely responsible for complying with Applicable Law wherever your Promotion is offered, as well as with Snap’s\\xa0[Promotions Rules](https://support.snapchat.com/en-US/a/promotions-rules). Unless Snap expressly otherwise agrees',\n ' in writing, Snap will not be a sponsor or an administrator of your Promotion. For purposes of these Business Services Terms, “Applicable Law” means applicable laws, statutes, ordinances, rules, public order rules, industry codes, and regulations.\\n\\n_In summary: To ensure our Services and other users are protected from harm, there are rules we need you to follow. You must adhere to certain restrictions in respect of data you collect or we make available to you relating to your use of the Business',\n ' Services.

You will not compromise or settle any claim in any manner, nor make any admission of liability, without Snap’s prior written consent, which Snap may pro',\n 'vide in its sole discretion.

Governing Law and Disputes\\n------------------------------\\n\\nIf you are contracting with any Snap entity other than\\xa0Snap Inc., then the following applies:\\n\\nThese Business Services Terms are governed by the\\xa0[Choice of Law](https://snap.com/en-US/terms/terms/#sgl-choice-of-law)\\xa0provision and the\\xa0[Exclusive Venue](https://snap.com/en-US/terms/#sgl-exclusive-venue)\\xa0provision of the\\xa0[Snap Group Limited Terms of Service](https://snap.com/en-US/terms/#terms-row).\\n\\nIf you are an entity, t',\n 'he\\xa0[Arbitration](https://snap.com/en-US/terms/#arbitration-row)\\xa0provision of the\\xa0[Snap Group Limited Terms of Service](https://snap.com/en-US/terms/#terms-row)\\xa0applies to your use of the Business Services.\\n\\nIf you are contracting with\\xa0Snap Inc., then the following applies:\\n\\nThe\\xa0[Choice of Law](https://snap.com/en-US/terms/#choice-of-law) and\\xa0[Exclusive Venue](https://snap.com/en-US/terms/#exclusive-venue)\\xa0provisions of the\\xa0[Snap Inc. Terms of Service](https://snap.com/en-US/terms)\\xa0apply to these',\n ' Business Services Terms, as well as the Arbitration provision in Section 7 below.\\n\\n**7\\\\. Arbitration, Class-Action Waiver, and Jury Waiver**\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTHE MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION IN THIS SECTION APPLIES IF YOU ARE CONTRACTING WITH SNAP INC. (IF YOU ARE CONTRACTING WITH ANY OTHER SNAP ENTITY, SEE THE [Arbitration](https://snap.com/en-US/terms/#arbitration-row)\\xa0provision of the\\xa0[Snap Group Limited Terms of Service](https://snap.com/en-US/te',\n 'rms/#terms-row).)\\n\\na. Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. In this Section 7 (the “Arbitration Agreement”), You and Snap agree that: (i) the [Arbitration](https://snap.com/en-US/terms/#arbitration)\\xa0provisions of the\\xa0[Snap Inc. Terms of Service](https://snap.com/en-US/terms) do not apply to your use of the Business Services, and (ii) instead, all claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise), including all statutory claims and disputes, arising out of or relating to these Business',\n ' Services Terms or the use of the Business Services that cannot be resolved in small claims court will be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis as set out in this Section 7, except that you and Snap are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents. To be clear: the phrase “all claims and disputes” also includes claims and disputes that arose',\n ' between us before the effective date of these Terms. In addition, all disputes concerning the arbitrability of a claim (including disputes about the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator, except as expressly provided below.\\n\\nb. Arbitration Rules. The Federal Arbitration Act, including its procedural provisions, governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute-resolution provision, and not state ',\n 'law. Arbitration will be conducted by ADR Services, Inc. (“ADR Services”) (https://www.adrservices.com/). If ADR Services is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum, and if they cannot agree, will ask the court to appoint an arbitrator pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 5. The rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbit',\n 'rator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount sought is less than $10,000 USD may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount sought is $10,000 USD or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the arbitral forum’s rules. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\\n\\nc. Additional Rules for Non-appearance Arbitrat',\n 'ion. If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, written submissions, or any combination of the three; the specific manner will be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.\\n\\nd. Fees. ADR Services sets forth fees for its services, which are available at https://www.adrservices.com/rate-fee-schedule/.\\xa0\\n\\ne. Auth',\n 'ority of the Arbitrator. The arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Snap. The dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under ',\n 'law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Snap.\\n\\nf. Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND SNAP WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND',\n ' STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Snap are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and Snap over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND SNAP WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have',\n ' the dispute be resolved by a judge.\\n\\ng. Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or ADR Services’ Rules, disputes regarding t',\n 'he interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this waiver may be resolved only by a court and not by an arbitrator. If this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in Section 7.\\n\\nh. Right to Waive. Any rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such w',\n 'aiver will not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.\\n\\ni. Opt-out. You may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you do so, neither you nor Snap can force the other to arbitrate. To opt out, you must notify Snap in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your Snapchat username and the email address you used to set up your Snapchat account (if you have one), and an unequ',\n 'ivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. You must either mail your opt-out notice to this address: Snap Inc., Attn: Arbitration Opt-out, 3000 31st Street, Santa Monica, CA 90405, or email the opt-out notice to arbitration-opt-out @ snap.com.\\n\\nj. Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Snap may bring an individual action in small claims court.\\n\\nk. Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of you',\n 'r relationship with Snap.\\n\\n8\\\\.

MTProto v.1.0 is deprecated and is curr',\n 'ently being phased out.\\n\\n### [](#diffie-hellman-key-exchange)Diffie-Hellman key exchange\\n\\nWe use DH key exchange in two cases:\\n\\n* [Creating an authorization key](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/auth_key)\\n* [Establishing Secret Chats with end-to-end encryption](https://core.telegram.org/api/end-to-end)\\n\\nIn both cases, there are some verifications to be done whenever DH is used:\\n\\n#### [](#validation-of-dh-parameters)Validation of DH parameters\\n\\nClient is expected to check whether **p = dh\\\\_prime',\n '** is a safe 2048-bit prime (meaning that both **p** and **(p-1)/2** are prime, and that 2^2047 < p < 2^2048), and that **g** generates a cyclic subgroup of prime order **(p-1)/2**, i.e. is a quadratic residue **mod p**. Since **g** is always equal to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7, this is easily done using quadratic reciprocity law, yielding a simple condition on **p mod 4g** -- namely, **p mod 8 = 7** for **g = 2**; **p mod 3 = 2** for **g = 3**; no extra condition for **g = 4**; **p mod 5 = 1 or 4** for',\n ' **g = 5**; **p mod 24 = 19 or 23** for **g = 6**; and **p mod 7 = 3, 5 or 6** for **g = 7**. After **g** and **p** have been checked by the client, it makes sense to cache the result, so as not to repeat lengthy computations in future.\\n\\nIf the verification takes too long (which is the case for older mobile devices), one might initially run only 15 Miller--Rabin iterations (use parameter 30 in Java) for verifying primeness of **p** and **(p - 1)/2** with error probability not exceeding one billi',\n 'onth, and do more iterations in the background later.\\n\\nAnother way to optimize this is to embed into the client application code a small table with some known \"good\" couples **(g,p)** (or just known safe primes **p**, since the condition on **g** is easily verified during execution), checked during code generation phase, so as to avoid doing such verification during runtime altogether. The server rarely changes these values, thus one usually needs to put the current value of server\\'s **dh\\\\_prime',\n '** into such a table. For example, the current value of **dh\\\\_prime** equals (in big-endian byte order)\\n\\n    C7 1C AE B9 C6 B1 C9 04 8E 6C 52 2F 70 F1 3F 73 98 0D 40 23 8E 3E 21 C1 49 34 D0 37 56 3D 93 0F 48 19 8A 0A A7 C1 40 58 22 94 93 D2 25 30 F4 DB FA 33 6F 6E 0A C9 25 13 95 43 AE D4 4C CE 7C 37 20 FD 51 F6 94 58 70 5A C6 8C D4 FE 6B 6B 13 AB DC 97 46 51 29 69 32 84 54 F1 8F AF 8C 59 5F 64 24 77 FE 96 BB 2A 94 1D 5B CD 1D 4A C8 CC 49 88 07 08 FA 9B 37 8E 3C 4F 3A 90 60 BE E6 7C F9 A4 A4 A6 9',\n '5 81 10 51 90 7E 16 27 53 B5 6B 0F 6B 41 0D BA 74 D8 A8 4B 2A 14 B3 14 4E 0E F1 28 47 54 FD 17 ED 95 0D 59 65 B4 B9 DD 46 58 2D B1 17 8D 16 9C 6B C4 65 B0 D6 FF 9C A3 92 8F EF 5B 9A E4 E4 18 FC 15 E8 3E BE A0 F8 7F A9 FF 5E ED 70 05 0D ED 28 49 F4 7B F9 59 D9 56 85 0C E9 29 85 1F 0D 81 15 F6 35 B1 05 EE 2E 4E 15 D0 4B 24 54 BF 6F 4F AD F0 34 B1 04 03 11 9C D8 E3 B9 2F CC 5B\\n\\n#### [](#g-a-and-g-b-validation)g\\\\_a and g\\\\_b validation\\n\\nApart from the conditions on the Diffie-Hellman prime **dh\\\\_prim',\n 'e** and generator **g**, both sides are to check that **g**, **g\\\\_a** and **g\\\\_b** are greater than **1** and less than **dh\\\\_prime - 1**. We recommend checking that **g\\\\_a** and **g\\\\_b** are between **2^{2048-64}** and **dh\\\\_prime - 2^{2048-64}** as well.\\n\\n#### [](#checking-sha1-hash-values-during-key-generation)Checking SHA1 hash values during key generation\\n\\nOnce the client receives a `server_DH_params_ok` answer in step 5) of the Authorization Key generation protocol and decrypts it obtainin',\n 'g `answer_with_hash`, it MUST check that\\n\\n    answer_with_hash := SHA1(answer) + answer + (0-15 random bytes)\\n\\nIn other words, the first 20 bytes of `answer_with_hash` must be equal to SHA1 of the remainder of the decrypted message without the padding random bytes.\\n\\n#### [](#checking-nonce-server-nonce-and-new-nonce-fields)Checking nonce, server\\\\_nonce and new\\\\_nonce fields\\n\\nWhen the client receives and/or decrypts server messages during creation of Authorization Key, and these messages contain ',\n 'some nonce fields already known to the client from messages previously obtained during the same run of the protocol, the client is to check that these fields indeed contain the values previosly known.\\n\\n#### [](#using-secure-pseudorandom-number-generator-to-create-dh-secret-parameters-a-and-b)Using secure pseudorandom number generator to create DH secret parameters `a` and `b`\\n\\nClient must use a cryptographically secure PRNG to generate secret exponents `a` or `b` for DH key exchange. For secret ',\n 'chats, the client might request some entropy (random bytes) from the server while invoking [messages.getDhConfig](https://core.telegram.org/method/messages.getDhConfig) and feed these random bytes into its PRNG (for example, by `PRNG_seed` if OpenSSL library is used), but never using these \"random\" bytes by themselves or replacing by them the local PRNG seed. One should mix bytes received from server into local PRNG seed.\\n\\n### [](#mtproto-encrypted-messages)MTProto Encrypted Messages\\n\\nSome impor',\n 'tant checks are to be done while sending and especially receiving [encrypted MTProto messages](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/description).\\n\\n#### [](#checking-sha256-hash-value-of-msg-key)Checking SHA256 hash value of msg\\\\_key\\n\\n`msg_key` is used not only to compute the AES key and IV to decrypt the received message. After decryption, the client **MUST** check that `msg_key` is indeed equal to SHA256 of the plaintext obtained as the result of decryption (including the final 12...1024 padding b',\n 'ytes), prepended with 32 bytes taken from the `auth_key`, as explained in [MTProto 2.0 Description](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/description#defining-aes-key-and-initialization-vector).\\n\\nIf an error is encountered before this check could be performed, the client **must** perform the `msg_key` check anyway before returning any result. Note that the response to any error encountered before the `msg_key` check **must** be the same as the response to a failed `msg_key` check.\\n\\n#### [](#checking',\n '-message-length)Checking message length\\n\\nThe client **must** check that the length of the message or container obtained from the decrypted message (computed from its `length` field) does not exceed the total size of the plaintext, and that the difference (i.e. the length of the random padding) lies in the range from 12 to 1024 bytes.\\n\\nThe length should be always divisible by 4 and non-negative. On no account the client is to access data past the end of the decryption buffer containing the plaint',\n 'ext message.\\n\\n#### [](#checking-session-id)Checking session\\\\_id\\n\\nThe client is to check that the `session_id` field in the decrypted message indeed equals to that of an active session created by the client.\\n\\n#### [](#checking-msg-id)Checking msg\\\\_id\\n\\nThe client must check that `msg_id` has even parity for messages from client to server, and odd parity for messages from server to client.\\n\\nIn addition, the identifiers (msg\\\\_id) of the last N messages received from the other side must be stored, an',\n 'd if a message comes in with an msg\\\\_id lower than all or equal to any of the stored values, that message is to be ignored. Otherwise, the new message msg\\\\_id is added to the set, and, if the number of stored msg\\\\_id values is greater than N, the oldest (i. e. the lowest) is discarded.\\n\\nIn addition, msg\\\\_id values that belong over 30 seconds in the future or over 300 seconds in the past are to be ignored (recall that `msg_id` approximately equals unixtime \\\\* 2^32). This is especially important f',\n 'or the server. The client would also find this useful (to protect from a replay attack), but only if it is certain of its time (for example, if its time has been synchronized with that of the server).\\n\\nCertain client-to-server service messages containing data sent by the client to the server (for example, `msg_id` of a recent client query) may, nonetheless, be processed on the client even if the time appears to be “incorrect”. This is especially true of messages to change server\\\\_salt and notifi',\n 'cations about invalid time on the client. See [Mobile Protocol: Service Messages](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/service_messages).\\n\\n[](#behavior-in-case-of-mismatch)Behavior in case of mismatch\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIf one of the checks listed above fails, the client is to completely discard the message obtained from server. We also recommend closing and reestablishing the TCP connection to the server, then retrying the operation or the whole key gene',\n 'ration protocol.\\n\\nNo information from incorrect messages can be used. Even if the application throws an exception and dies, this is much better than continuing with invalid data.\\n\\nNotice that invalid messages will infrequently appear during normal work even if no malicious tampering is being done. This is due to network transmission errors. We recommend ignoring the invalid message and closing the TCP connection, then creating a new TCP connection to the server and retrying the original query.\\n\\n',\n '> The previous version of security recommendations relevant for MTProto 1.0 clients is available [here](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/security_guidelines_v1).',\n '* [API](https://core.telegram.org/api)\\n* [Telegram API Terms of Service](https://core.telegram.org/api/terms)\\n\\nTelegram API Terms of Service\\n=============================\\n\\nWe welcome all developers to use our API and source code to [create Telegram-like messaging applications](https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id) on our platform free of charge.

The Scope of Premium Services\\n\\n#### [](#7-1-included-services)7.',\n '1. Included Services\\n\\nThe services included in the Telegram Premium subscription (“Premium Services”) are listed in the Premium Section. From time to time, we may add new items into the Premium Services, including limited-time or promotional access to additional paid features and subscriptions, such as [Telegram Business](https://telegram.org/blog/telegram-business). In such cases, your access to those features is further subject to their specific Terms of Service.\\n\\nWe may also remove some of th',\n 'e existing Premium Services if we are no longer able to provide them for legal or technical reasons. In addition, some Premium Services may become free of charge for all Telegram users in the future or be offered as a separate membership tier.\\n\\n#### [](#7-2-availability)7.2. Availability\\n\\nTelegram strives to make its services available for all users all the time, but occasional technical issues may occur, temporarily preventing us from delivering services, including Premium Services, to our user',\n 's. Telegram will not compensate you for any direct or indirect loss resulting from our temporary inability to provide any free or paid services.\\n\\nPremium Services are available on major Telegram clients, such as the official iOS and Android apps. Some Telegram apps made by Telegram or by third parties may not offer all Premium Services immediately after they are launched or at all.\\n\\n#### [](#7-3-software-requirements)7.3. Software Requirements\\n\\nSome Premium Services may require the latest versio',\n 'n of the Telegram application to be installed on your device. In some cases, users you interact with may also need to have the latest version of the Telegram application installed on their devices in order to be able to view the content you share with them by the use of Premium Services. For example, exclusive stickers available only to the Telegram Premium subscribers or documents larger than 2 GB may be correctly viewed only by users with an up-to-date version of Telegram.\\n\\nIn general, users y',\n 'ou interact with will not have to purchase a Telegram Premium subscription in order to view the content you share with them by the use of Premium Services.\\n\\n#### [](#7-4-chat-translation-and-voice-to-text-conversion)7.4. Chat translation and Voice-to-text conversion\\n\\nPremium Services include the optional ability to request the conversion of any video and voice message on Telegram to text. Additionally, the services include optional live translation for any chat, group or channel.\\n\\nThese technolo',\n 'gies are still evolving and there is no guarantee that every message you attempt to either transcribe or translate will be processed correctly, or at all. The accuracy and availability of these technologies depend on a third party (Google LLC, subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.), and we can not guarantee that they will always be accurate and available.\\n\\n> Read more about the privacy of this data in our [Privacy Policy](https://telegram.org/privacy#8-5-transcription-of-voice-messages-at-the-request-of-t',\n 'he-user)\\n\\n#### [](#7-5-increased-download-speed)7.5. Increased Download Speed\\n\\nPremium Services include increased download speed of media and documents on Telegram. This increase is allowed by the removal of all relevant speed limits on Telegram’s side. However, your actual download speed will also depend on external factors such as your hardware, your internet provider and certain intermediary connectivity providers. Therefore, there is no guarantee that enabling Premium Services will always af',\n \"fect the speed with which you download documents and media on Telegram.\\n\\n#### [](#7-6-the-absence-of-advertisements)7.6. The Absence of Advertisements\\n\\nIn certain countries Telegram shows sponsored messages in one-to-many channels that have over 1000 subscribers. The subscribers of Telegram Premium won't see such sponsored messages displayed by Telegram. However, channels on Telegram are managed by other users, their administrators, who may publish their own content featuring third-party promoti\",\n 'ons or sponsorships. These ads are not part of the Telegram advertisement platform and subscribers of Telegram Premium may still see them.\\n\\n#### [](#7-7-boosts)7.7. Boosts\\n\\nPremium Services provide users with a number of “boosts” which they can assign to channels to contribute to increasing the level of these channels, with each level unlocking or extending certain features for the channel.\\n\\nA purchased Telegram Premium subscription provides 4 boosts. Gifted subscriptions provide 1 boost to the ',\n 'gift recipient and 3 boosts to the gifter. Telegram Premium subscriptions distributed via giveaways in channels do not provide boosts to the accounts that activate them and instead boost the channel which organized the giveaway.\\n\\nLeveling requirements, unlockable features and earned boosts may be altered or removed at any time.\\n\\n#### [](#7-8-giveaways-in-channels)7.8. Giveaways in Channels\\n\\nChannel admins can organize giveaways at their expense, purchasing a number of premium subscriptions to be',\n ' distributed among present or future subscribers and immediately gain 4 boosts per purchased subscription. The boosts received by the channel can’t be reassigned to another channel, they are activated the moment the giveaway is first launched and remain active for the purchased duration of the subscriptions distributed in the giveaway.\\n\\nTelegram selects winners based on the criteria that channel administrators choose when setting up the giveaway. The results are final and cannot be altered or re',\n 'versed. In the rare chance that a technical issue results in an unintended outcome, Telegram will attempt to rectify the situation but makes no guarantees to the organizers of a giveaway or its participants.\\n\\nWinners of a giveaway will receive a shareable link that contains a unique gift code which confirms that they won and activates a Telegram Premium subscription, but does not provide any boosts for the user account that activated it.\\n\\nGiveaways are available for purchase on Telegram’s store ',\n 'apps, direct and web versions and on Fragment. Prices may vary between each option. All purchases are nonrefundable. If there are not enough eligible participants to distribute all the prizes, the channel admins will receive all the undistributed premium activation links, to be used at the admins’ discretion. Undistributed prizes cannot be “rolled over” into other giveaways.\\n\\nAdmins who sponsored a giveaway are not entitled to a refund if they lose access to their channel. Reasons for losing acc',\n 'ess include but are not limited to being demoted, banned, transferring ownership, and the channel being deleted by its owner or restricted by Telegram due to violations of these Terms of Service or the terms of app stores.\\n\\nChannels that mislead users into joining by means of giveaways that are later refunded with a third party (e.g., a bank) may be terminated or assigned a _scam_ label and removed from Telegram search. Subscribers gained as a result of such actions may be removed from the chann',\n 'el sponsoring the giveaway, all channels listed in the selection criteria and other associated channels at our sole discretion.\\n\\nCertain countries or jurisdictions may impose regulatory constraints on giveaways. If you run a giveaway, you are solely responsible for complying with applicable law. You explicitly acknowledge that Telegram is not liable in the event of sanctions, fees, and any form of legal or administrative action incurred as a result of or in relation to your use of the “Giveaway”',\n ' feature provided by Telegram.\\n\\nChannel admins can use the Giveaway feature to announce arbitrary prizes in addition to premium subscriptions. Should they choose to do so, they are solely responsible for delivering said prizes to giveaway winners. Telegram will not be liable if any disputes arise in relation to the prizes, their delivery or lack thereof.',\n 'How the site works\\n==================\\n\\n1\\\\.

The process can be longer i',\n 'f the review needs to be examined in more detail by our team of moderators. It may also take longer if you review a vacation rental property that you booked through Tripadvisor or one of our affiliate company’s online platforms. See [here](https://www.tripadvisorsupport.com/en-US/hc/traveler/articles/574) for more info.\\n\\nAfter submitting, the title of your review appears in your profile, on the [Review page](https://www.tripadvisor.com/members-reviews).\\n\\nIf we are unable to host your review, you',\n ' may be notified of the refusal and the reason for this.

How long will my review appear?\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nOnce posted, your review will appear indefinitely on our site. Your review will only be removed if:\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n1) You choose to [remove it](https://www.tripadvisorsupport.com/en-US/hc/traveler/ar',\n 'ticles/344)\\xa0\\n\\n2) our team of moderators has determined that this review did not meet our [Guidelines.](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Trust-lvBd3L1aU38Y-Review_posting_guidelines.html)\\n\\n3) You fail to click on the link contained with an email asking you to validate your review, as outlined above\\n\\n4) an establishment is removed from our site, in which case all reviews are removed.\\n\\n5) An establishment goes through an ownership change or major renovation and reviews prior to a certain date that are n',\n 'o longer relevant are removed\\n\\n12\\\\. Can I be rewarded for a review?\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nNo. Reviews written in exchange for personal benefits, such as gifts, services or money, will be removed.\\n\\nEstablishments are free to encourage their clients to post their reviews when they return home. However, no representative of the establishment can offer premium, discount, upgrade or special treatment for current or future stays in exchange for advice. Properties making such offers may',\n ' have their rankings penalized.\\n\\nIf someone has offered you a reward for a review, please let us know by emailing us and including any available evidence (screenshots, photos, etc) at [incentives@tripadvisor.com](mailto:incentives@tripadvisor.com)\\n\\n13\\\\. Is it possible to modify a review?\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nNo, Once submitted, your review can not be edited.

Will my review appear on other websites or publications?\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAfter being posted, all or part of the reviews written by our members may be used on some of our partner sites or in promotional materials generally.\\n\\nFor more information, read our [Terms of Use](https://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/terms.html) and our [Privac',\n \"y Policy](https://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/privacy.html).\\n\\n15\\\\. If I write a review about an establishment, can I be contacted about it?\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSharing a contributor's e-mail address to an owner, manager, or other person is against our privacy policy. Contributors remain anonymous unless they choose to publish their email address or contact information in a contribution, such as a review or message in a forum.\\n\\nHowever, pro\",\n \"perty owners or managers may contact you through Tripadvisor's private messaging system, which allows Tripadvisor members to be in contact without providing an email address. Owners can use the messaging system to thank contributors, ask for other comments, legitimately attempt to resolve customer service issues, or (in the case of vacation rental property owners or managers) discuss a booking with a user, but they are not allowed to ask contributors to retract a review via the mailing system. I\",\n 't is also strictly forbidden to harass contributors.\\n\\nFor more information, see our [rules](https://www.tripadvisorsupport.com/en-US/hc/traveler/categories/101) for using private messaging.\\n\\n16\\\\. AI-Powered review summaries\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nTripadvisor facilitates easier and more informative hotel, restaurant, and experience searches by presenting AI-powered Review Summaries. These summaries, generated through state-of-the-art generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), offe',\n 'r concise, impartial highlights of traveler reviews on Tripadvisor from the previous 12 months, focusing on key attributes like cleanliness, location, and value. The summaries are derived solely from user-generated content, with supporting quotes added for transparency. Advanced machine learning techniques including Retrieval-Augmented Generation and BART are employed to preserve the authenticity of the original reviews while providing a clear, practical overview. This technology enables users t',\n 'o quickly understand the essence of traveler opinions, assisting in informed decision-making. Travellers should read the summaries in the context of the original user reviews on which they are based. Tripadvisor provides this feature for convenience and does not endorse or assume responsibility for the content of the summaries.\\xa0\\n\\nTo learn more about how these AI-powered summaries are generated, please visit our [detailed blog post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/revolutionizing-travel-reviews-tr',\n 'ipadvisors-ai-driven-summaries-2xpqe/?trackingId=RqCSSirrSBms%2FvYoN5tIhw%3D%3D) (available only in English).\\n\\n17\\\\. Translation of reviews\\n---------------------------\\n\\nTo assist our global community of travelers, Tripadvisor uses the services of Google and [Phrase](https://phrase.com/), both third-party vendors, to provide automated translations of user reviews. This helps ensure that all travelers, regardless of their language preferences, can access and benefit from the insights shared by othe',\n 'rs. Phrase and Google employ advanced translation technologies to convert user-generated content into multiple languages accurately and efficiently, enhancing the accessibility of our platform. Please note that while our vendors strive for accurate translations, some variations might occur due to linguistic differences. Tripadvisor plays no role in these translations, does not guarantee their accuracy and does not endorse the content of any individual user review or its translation.',\n 'Terms of Use\\n============\\n\\nLast Updated: 16 February 2024\\n\\n**Terms of Use**\\n\\n[USE OF THE SERVICES](#_USE_OF_THE)\\n\\n[ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS](#_ADDITIONAL_PRODUCTS)\\n\\n[PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES](#_PROHIBITED_ACTIVITIES)\\n\\n[PRIVACY POLICY AND DISCLOSURES](#_PRIVACY_POLICY_AND)\\n\\n[REVIEWS, COMMENTS AND USE OF OTHER INTERACTIVE AREAS; LICENCE GRANT](#_REVIEWS,_COMMENTS_AND)\\n\\n* [Restricting Tripadvisor’s Licence Rights](#_Restricting_Tripadvisor%E2%80%99s_Licence)\\n\\n[BOOKING WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS THROUGH Tri',\n 'padvisor](#_BOOKING_WITH_THIRD-PARTY)\\n\\n* [Use of Tripadvisor Booking Services](#_Use_of_Tripadvisor)\\n* [Third-Party Suppliers](#_Third-Party_Suppliers._The)\\n* [Booking Holiday Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites](#_Booking_Holiday_Rentals,)\\n\\n[TRAVEL DESTINATIONS](#_TRAVEL_DESTINATIONS)\\n\\n* [International Travel](#_International_Travel._When)\\n\\n[LIABILITY DISCLAIMER](#_LIABILITY_DISCLAIMER_1)\\n\\n[INDEMNIFICATION](#_Indemnific',\n 'ation)\\n\\n[LINKS TO THIRD-PARTY SITES](#_LINKS_TO_THIRD-PARTY)\\n\\n[SOFTWARE AS PART OF SERVICES; ADDITIONAL MOBILE LICENCES](#_SOFTWARE_AS_PART)\\n\\n[COPYRIGHT AND TRADEMARK NOTICES](#_COPYRIGHT_AND_TRADEMARK)\\n\\n* [Notice and Take-Down Policy for Illegal Content](#_Notice_and_Take-Down)\\n\\n[MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT; THE SERVICES; UPDATES; TERMINATION](#_MODIFICATIONS_TO_THE)\\xa0AND WITHDRAWAL\\n\\n[JURISDICTION AND GOVERNING LAW](#_JURISDICTION_AND_GOVERNING)\\n\\n[CURRENCY CONVERTER](#_CURRENCY_CONVERTER)\\n\\n[',\n 'GENERAL PROVISIONS](#_GENERAL_PROVISIONS)\\n\\n[SERVICE HELP](#_SERVICE_HELP)\\n\\nWelcome to the Tripadvisor websites and mobile properties located at\\xa0www.tripadvisor.ie/ and applicable country top level domains (including sub-domains associated with them), related software applications (sometimes referred to as “apps”), data, SMS, APIs, email, chat and telephone correspondence, buttons, widgets and ads (collectively, all of these items shall be referred to herein as the “**Services**”; more generally,',\n ' the Tripadvisor websites and mobile properties shall hereinafter be referred to herein as “websites”).\\n\\nThe Services are provided by Tripadvisor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company located in the United States of America (“**Tripadvisor**”) with its registered office at Tripadvisor LLC, 400 1st Avenue, Needham, MA 02494, USA.

When you post your Content to the Services, the licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies in Your Content shall be limited to a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, reproduce, publicly display or perform, translate and create derivative works of your Content for purposes of displaying such on the',\n ' Services, as well as using your name and/or trademark in connection with that Content. Subject to Paragraph 6 below, the Restricted Licence applies to any of your Content (again, other than text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g. a third party that contributes to or otherwise manages your account) make available on or in connection with the Services.\\n\\n1. As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence, you can ter',\n 'minate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from the Services. \\xa0Correspondingly, you may terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is available\\xa0[**here**](https://www.tripadvisorsupport.com/en-GB/hc/traveler/articles/510)). \\xa0Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the e',\n 'xtent you shared it with others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time.\\n\\n1. The Tripadvisor Companies will not use your Content in advertisem',\n 'ents for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others. \\xa0In all instances in which your Content is displayed on the',\n ' Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with your Content.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n1. The Tripadvisor Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made \"public\" and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post or other',\n 'wise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services.\\n\\n1. Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this Agreement. The licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies as modified by these paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred',\n ' to as a “Restricted Licence”.\\n\\n1. For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other Tripadvisor Companies services or programmes is not subject to the Restricted Licence, but shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific Tripadvisor service or programme.\\n\\n**BOOKING WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS THROUGH Tripadvisor**\\n\\n#### Use of Tripadvisor Booking Services. The Tripadvisor Companies offer you the ability to search for, s',\n 'elect, and book travel reservations with third-party suppliers without leaving the Services.\\n\\n#### IMPORTANT: Tripadvisor does not itself sell travel reservations. Tripadvisor allows third parties to sell their travel reservations on Tripadvisor.\\n\\n#### Tripadvisor may facilitate the promotion and sale of travel reservations by third parties to you. Tripadvisor is not, however, the party that undertakes the promotion and/or sale. If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, the contract',\n ' for the reservation is always solely between you and the third-party. Tripadvisor is not (a) the buyer or the seller of reservation; (b) a party to the contract with the third-party or responsible for the fulfilment of that contract; or (c) an agent of you or the third-party in connection with purchase or sale. If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s terms and conditions of purchase and website use, privacy policy and any other r',\n 'ules or policies related to the supplier’s site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers.\\n\\nYour rights of recourse in connection with a contract',\n ' between you and a third-party supplier (for example, in relation to refunds and cancellations), will be between you and the third party as set out in the contract with that third-party. In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy as between us and you will be for you to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation and obtain a refund (if applicable and subject to ',\n 'applicable law and your contract with the third-party supplier).\\n\\n#### Third party suppliers may be businesses or consumers. If you are a consumer resident in the UK or EU, and the third party supplier you contract with is also consumer please note that you will not be able to enforce any consumer rights against that supplier.\\n\\n#### By booking travel reservations via the websites, you will need to create an account if you have not already, and you acknowledge that you accept the practices descri',\n 'bed in our Privacy Policy and this Agreement.\\n\\nAS A USER OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING TRIPADVISOR COMPANIES’ BOOKING FACILITATION SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW: (1) THE TRIPADVISOR COMPANIES WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY UNAUTHORISED TRANSACTIONS MADE USING YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT; AND (2) THE UNAUTHORISED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO TRIPADVISOR, ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES AND/OR OT',\n 'HERS.\\n\\nUsing our Services, including creating a Tripadvisor account, is free of charge, and a payment will only processed when you book a reservation via the Services. When you book a reservation facilitated by the Tripadvisor Companies, your payment information will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the supplier, not the Tripadvisor Companies, is responsible for processing your payment and fulfilling yo',\n 'ur reservation.\\n\\nThe Tripadvisor Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The Tripadvisor Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request.\\n\\n**Third-Party Suppliers.**\\xa0The T',\n 'ripadvisor Companies are not travel agencies and do not provide or own transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences. Although the Tripadvisor Companies display information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain suppliers on or through the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest or constitute the Tripadvisor Companies’ sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers,',\n ' or any affiliation between the Tripadvisor Companies and third-party suppliers. Although users may rate and review particular transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences based on their own experiences, the Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that Tripadvisor does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by users. The Tripadvisor Companies do not endors',\n 'e any Content posted, submitted or otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein, and the Tripadvisor Companies expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with such Content. You agree that the Tripadvisor Companies are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services.\\n\\nThe Services may link you to supplier sites or other sites that Tripadvisor doe',\n 's not operate or control. For further information, please refer to the “Links to Third-Party Sites” section below.\\n\\n**Booking Travel Services via the Tripadvisor Mobile App.**\\xa0 Some of the travel services booked via Tripadvisor’s mobile app are governed by an additional set of terms of use.\\xa0 Those terms are available through the app itself and can be found\\xa0[here](https://tripadvisor.mediaroom.com/us-terms-of-use-booking).\\n\\n#### **Booking Holiday Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences w',\n 'ith Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites.**\\xa0Some of Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates act as marketplaces to facilitate travellers’ ability to (1) enter into holiday rental agreements with property owners and managers (“Holiday Rentals”), (2) make reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3) make reservations for tours, activities and attractions (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such Experiences (each such supplier of a holiday rental and/',\n 'or Experience to be referred to as an “Advertiser”). Those corporate affiliates of Tripadvisor syndicate their advertisements to other entities within the Tripadvisor Companies group and that is why you see them on the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites. \\xa0As a user, you must be responsible for your use of the Services (including, in particular, the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites), and any transaction involving Holiday Rentals, Restaurants or Experiences facilitated by Tripadvisor’s corporate affil',\n 'iates. We do not own, manage or contract for any Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience listed on the Services.\\n\\nBecause neither Tripadvisor nor its corporate affiliates are parties to Holiday Rental transactions, Restaurant reservations or Experience-related transactions between travellers and Advertisers, any dispute or conflict involving an actual or potential transaction between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition(s), safety or legality of a listed Holiday Rental, Resta',\n 'urant or Experience, the accuracy of the listing Content, the Advertiser’s ability to rent a Holiday Rental property, provide you with a reservation, meal or other service at a Restaurant or provide an Experience, or your ability to pay for a Holiday Rental property, a Restaurant meal or service or an Experience, is solely the responsibility of each user.\\n\\nOne of Tripadvisor’ corporate affiliates may act as an Advertiser’s limited agent solely for the purpose of transmitting your payment to the ',\n 'Advertiser. You agree to pay an Advertiser, or a Tripadvisor corporate affiliate acting as limited payment collection agent on behalf of an Advertiser, any fee(s) specified to you in advance of you making a booking for any Holiday Rental reservation or Experience and any fees charged to you as a result of damage caused by your use of the Rental reservation or experience in accordance with any applicable terms or policy.\\n\\nFor further information on Holiday Rental fees, security deposits, fees for',\n \" Experiences, payment processing, refunds and the like, please consult our affiliates’ terms and conditions (for Experiences visit\\xa0[**Viator**](https://www.viator.com/en-IE/support/termsAndConditions?localeSwitch=1); for Restaurants visit\\xa0[**The Fork**](https://www.thefork.co.uk/#geo_dmn_redirect=20210629AT100); for holiday rentals, visit\\xa0[Tripadvisor Companies' Holiday Rentals.](https://rentals.tripadvisor.com/en_UK/termsandconditions/traveler)\\xa0By making a Holiday Rental reservation, Restaurant\",\n ' reservation or Experience reservation facilitated by one of our corporate affiliates, you will have to acknowledge and agree to its terms and conditions, as well as its privacy policy.\\n\\nIf you enter into a dispute with an Advertiser in the EU, alternative methods for resolving that dispute are available online here:\\xa0[http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/main/index.cfm?event=main.home2.show&lng=EN).\\n\\n**TRAVEL DESTINATIONS**\\n\\n#### **International Travel.**\\xa0When y',\n 'ou book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers or plan international trips using the Services, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order.\\n\\nFor passport and visa requirements, please consult the relevant embassy or consulate for information. Because requirements may change at any time, be sure to check for up-to-date information before booking and departure. The Tr',\n 'ipadvisor Companies accept no liability for travellers who are refused entry onto a flight or into any country because of the traveller’s failure to carry the travel documents required by any airline, authority or country, including countries the traveller may just be passing through en route to his or her destination.\\n\\nIt is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health ent',\n 'ry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip.\\n\\nAlthough most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Tripadvisor urges travellers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by their own governments and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. For example, informat',\n 'ion on conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations is provided by the United States Government at\\xa0[www.state.gov](file:///C:/Users/emma.finlayson/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/7XIGGZH4/www.state.gov),\\xa0[www.tsa.gov](https://www.tsa.gov/),[www.dot.gov](file:///C:/Users/emma.finlayson/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/7XIGGZH4/www.dot.gov),\\xa0[www.faa.gov](file:///C:/Users/emm',\n 'a.finlayson/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/7XIGGZH4/www.faa.gov),\\xa0[www.cdc.gov](file:///C:/Users/emma.finlayson/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/7XIGGZH4/www.cdc.gov),\\xa0[www.treas.gov/ofac](file:///C:/Users/emma.finlayson/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/7XIGGZH4/www.treas.gov/ofac)\\xa0and\\xa0[www.customs.gov](file:///C:/Users/emma.finlayson/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/7XIGGZH4/www.customs.gov).\\n\\n',\n 'BY LISTING INFORMATION RELEVANT TO TRAVEL TO PARTICULAR INTERNATIONAL DESTINATIONS, THE TRIPADVISOR COMPANIES DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT TRAVEL TO SUCH POINTS IS ADVISABLE OR WITHOUT RISK, AND IS NOT LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OR LOSSES THAT MAY RESULT FROM TRAVEL TO SUCH DESTINATIONS.\\n\\n**LIABILITY DISCLAIMER**\\n\\nPLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.
