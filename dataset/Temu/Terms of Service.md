**1.4** Your use of, and participation in, certain Services is subject to additional policies(“Policies”). We update these Policies and publish new Policies as needed from time to time. If the Terms are inconsistent with the Policies, the Policies shall control with respect to the relevant subject matter.

**1.5** We reserve the right to make modifications to these Terms that do not affect this Section 1.5 or our main performance obligations and are not equivalent to the conclusion of a new contract. Such modifications will be posted at the “Terms of use” links in the Temu website footer and in the “Settings” menu in the Temu app. The modifications will only form part of these Terms upon acceptance by you. We will inform you of modifications. If you do not object to the modified Terms within three weeks, you shall be deemed to have accepted. When we notify you regarding modifications to the Terms, we will inform you of the conditions under which they will be deemed accepted by you.

When creating your account on Temu (“Account”), you agree to provide true, accurate, complete, and updated information about yourself, including contact details. You are responsible for keeping your registration information with us up to date. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your Account. You agree that you shall monitor your Account to restrict use by minors, and you will accept full responsibility for any unauthorized use of the Services by minors which you enable or facilitate.

You may not transfer your Account to anyone else without our prior written permission. We reserve the right to suspend and ban users for breach of these Terms and our Policies. You agree not to create an Account or use the Services if you have been permanently banned from any of the Services.

Depending on the SNS Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such SNS Accounts, personal information that you post to your SNS Accounts may be available on and through your Account on the Services. Please note that if a SNS Account or associated service becomes unavailable, or our access to such SNS Account is terminated by the SNS, then SNS Content will no longer be available on and through the Services.

You undertake that the User Submissions that are viewable by other users are made truthfully in good faith and based only on your first-hand experience. You further undertake that you will prominently indicate if a User Submission was sponsored or paid for in any way. You acknowledge that we have no obligation to pre-screen User Submissions, although we reserve the right to pre-screen, refuse, exclude or remove any User Submission. By entering into these Terms, you hereby provide your irrevocable consent to such monitoring and moderation. In the event that we pre-screen, refuse, exclude or remove any User Submissions, you acknowledge that we will do so for our benefit, not yours. Without limiting the foregoing, we shall have the right to remove any User Submissions that violate the Terms or are otherwise objectionable.

You undertake to comply with all copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and restrictions contained in the Content, and not to copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell, or otherwise use for any purpose any Content not owned by you without the prior consent of the owner of that Content.

**7.5** You may not make any commercial use of any of the information provided on the Services or make any use of the Services for the benefit of another business unless explicitly permitted by us in advance.

**10.1** You are responsible for reading the full product listing before purchasing a product. By confirming your purchase, you agree to pay all applicable fees, taxes, shipping costs and other amounts associated with your purchase.

If additional amounts are assessed, you are responsible for them. We will not be liable if a product is delayed or denied customs clearance as a result of your failure to pay such amounts.

**10.2** While we strive to provide accurate information on Temu, typographical errors, inaccuracies, or omissions that relate to pricing, product descriptions, availability, and offers may occur.

You should not rely on the strike-through price in your purchase decision. If comparing prices is important to your purchase decision, you should do your own comparison before making a purchase.

**10.3** Please check all descriptions and restrictions regarding the product you are interested in thoroughly before you place your order. If you have any special circumstance (e.g., a medical or health condition and/or special need) that may affect or be affected by the product you wish to purchase, it is solely your responsibility to inform us before you place your order.

**10.4** We make reasonable efforts to ensure the colour display of the products on Temu is as accurate as possible. However, we cannot guarantee that your monitor’s display of any colour will be an accurate depiction of the colour of the product you selected to purchase.

**10.5** You acknowledge that the products are in conformity with the transaction or intended purchase if they: (i) comply with the description provided on Temu and possess the qualities presented on Temu; (ii) are fit for the purposes for which goods of such kind are normally used; and (iii) are of the quality and performance which are normal in goods of the same type and which can reasonably be expected.

You must promptly update your account with any changes related to your payment method. BY PROVIDING INFORMATION FOR A PAYMENT METHOD AND APPROVING A SPECIFIC PURCHASE PAYMENT, YOU AUTHORIZE US OR OUR AGENTS OR PAYMENT SERVICE PROCESSORS TO CHARGE THE PAYMENT METHOD FOR: (A) AMOUNTS DUE FOR THE SPECIFIC PRODUCTS WHICH YOU ARE SEEKING TO PURCHASE; (B) ANY AND ALL APPLICABLE CUSTOMS, TAXES AND SHIPPING COSTS; AND (C) ANY OTHER CHARGES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES AS SUMMARISED PRIOR TO YOUR APPROVAL OF THE PAYMENT. We may decline, freeze or hold your transaction for any reason, including for suspected fraud, anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance, or if we believe your transaction poses a risk to us or any third party.

**10.7** Payment Processors may charge you fees for your purchases made through Temu. Such processing fees will be disclosed to you via Temu. Your use of the Services and the payment processing provided by the Payment Processor is subject to your agreement with the Payment Processor, as may be modified from time to time.

12\. Rewards
------------

**12.1** You may receive credits, coupons, cash, gifts or other kinds of reward by use of the Services (collectively, “Rewards”). Some rewards may only be used for discounts on or payment for eligible purchases on or through the Services (but note that not all products may be eligible) and cannot be redeemed for cash, except in jurisdictions where required by law. You should read carefully the information and applicable rules regarding different kinds of rewards.

13\. Ending Our Relationship
----------------------------

**13.1** You are free to stop using the Services at any time. We are also free to terminate or suspend your use of the Services or your account, where you breach these Terms or the Policies, as determined by us acting reasonably. Even after your use of the Services is terminated or suspended, these Terms will remain enforceable against you and any unpaid amount you owe to us will remain due.

**13.2** If your account is terminated, all Content and Rewards associated with your account will be forfeited and cancelled. You should try to use any remaining Rewards before the date on which such termination becomes effective.

**13.3** All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive, shall survive termination of these Terms, including without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.

14\. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY  

-------------------------------

**14.1** We shall only be liable towards you with respect to our contractual obligation to provide the Services. In no event shall we be liable for any actions or omissions of any third parties.

**14.2** Our liability towards you is governed by the following rules:

(1) We assume unlimited liability for damages caused wilfully or as a result of gross negligence by us, by our employees, and by our vicarious agents, as well as in the event of fraudulent non-disclosure of defaults, explicit guarantees, and damages arising from personal injuries (life, body and health).

(2) We shall only be liable for other damages if they result from a violation of an obligation that must be observed to make the due performance of the agreement possible and the observation of which the other party to the agreement can usually rely. At the same time, our liability for such other damages is limited to those damages that are deemed typical for this type of contract and foreseeable. We are not liable for any unforeseeable losses. Unforeseeable losses are losses that are unexpected, and it was not obvious that they would arise, and there was nothing you said to us before entering this Agreement that meant that we should have expected them to arise. Possible liabilities according to product liability law remain unaffected. Any further liability is excluded.

(3) We do not warrant or assume liability for obligations according to facilitated contracts with any third parties.

(4) Furthermore, we shall not be liable for the accuracy, reliability, or completeness of the Content provided by us on Temu free of charge or any damages that may arise from such Content.

15\. Indemnity
--------------

**15.1** You agree to indemnify us against any and all claims asserted by other users or other third parties against us based on the infringement of their rights by your use of the Services or your violation of these Terms. In indemnifying us under this Section, you shall bear our costs of necessary legal defence. This does not apply if you are not responsible for such claim. In the event of an indemnified claim under this Section 15, you must provide us immediately and accurately all information necessary for the examination of the claims and a defence.

16\. App Stores
---------------

**16.1 Application License.** Subject to your compliance with the Terms, we grant you a limited non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to download, install and use a copy of the Temu mobile application (“Application”) on a device or computer that you own or control. Furthermore, with respect to any Application accessed through or downloaded from the Apple App Store (an “App Store Sourced Application”), you will only use the App Store Sourced Application (a) on an Apple-branded product that runs the iOS (Apple’s proprietary operating system) and (b) as permitted by the “Usage Rules” set forth in the Apple App Store Terms of Service. Notwithstanding the first sentence in this section, with respect to any App Store Sourced Application or any Application accessed through or downloaded from the Google Play store (a “Google Play Sourced Application”), you may have additional rights with respect to access to and use of the Application applicable to volume purchasing or via Family Sharing on Apple -branded Products or a shared basis within your designated family group subject to the applicable Apple or Google terms and your associated settings.

**16.2 App Stores.** You acknowledge and agree that the availability of the Application and the Services is dependent on the third party from whom you received the Application license, e.g., the Apple App Store or Google Play (each, an “App Store”). You acknowledge that the Terms are between you and us and not with the App Store. We, not the App Store, are solely responsible for the Services, including the Application, the content thereof, maintenance, support services, and warranty therefor, and addressing any claims relating thereto (e.g., product liability, legal compliance or intellectual property infringement). In order to use the Application, you must have access to a wireless network, and you agree to pay all fees associated with such access. You also agree to pay all fees (if any) charged by the App Store in connection with The Services, including the Application.
