How we keep reviews trustworthy and useful?

To ensure only real customers post reviews, we have submission requirements. Customers who have purchased items on Temu are eligible to submit ratings and reviews for the items they have purchased.

Before posting a review, we check if it meets our Review Guidelines.

Our automated and human checks stop millions of suspicious reviews before customers ever see them. We also take legal action against groups that pay customers to post fake reviews.

We listen to our customers. If you think a review violates our guidelines, you can report the review and we'll investigate it.

How we calculate overall star ratings?

Temu calculates a star rating using machine-learned models instead of a simple average. They use multiple criteria that establish the authenticity and trustworthiness of the review. The system continues to learn and improve over time.

What are our review guidelines?

When you write reviews about Temu or items sold on Temu, you should:

1\. Be truthful.

Your review, including words, photos, and other materials, should be about your own experience on Temu or about a product sold on Temu. Your review should not mislead viewers about any feature, function, or quality of a product.

2\. Be respectful.

Your review should not contain anything that is obscene, libelous, hateful, violent, offensive, illegal, sexually explicit, or otherwise inappropriate.

3\. Respect intellectual property rights.

Your review should not contain any material that you do not have permission to use or infringes on any intellectual property of any third party.

4\. Use product as intended.

Your review should be about using a product as intended by the manufacturer. Your review should not depict a product being used in an unintended manner, especially in any unsafe or illegal manner.

5\. Be mindful of privacy.

Your review should not contain personal information of your own or a third party, including phone numbers, mailing addresses, email addresses, etc.

6\. Do not mention competitors.

Your review should not compare products or services of other competitors by name.

7\. Do not mention promotional codes.

Your review should not contain any information about promotional codes or invitation codes.

How long are reviews displayed?

As long as the review meets the review guidelines and the item is on sale, the review will be displayed.
