**2.**  **Terms for specific Online Transactions**

**2.1.**  **Refusal or Cancellation of Online Transactions.** AliExpress.com reserves the right to suspend to clarify and subsequently or directly refuse/reject or cancel any Online Transaction which we, acting reasonably, determine to be in breach of this Contract (including the related documents referred to in clause 1.4 above), or impose penalties or restrictions, for any relevant reason, including compliance with consumers' protection, e-commerce, fraud, cybersecurity or intellectual and industrial property rights regulations or at the request of the competent authorities, without any liability for any losses or damages arising out of or in connection with such refusal or cancellation. ANY restriction to your use of the Sites will be notified to you via your buyer Message Center.

  

The assessment on the breach of this Contract will be conducted internally, by affected departments of AliExpress.com, including Platform Governance, Risk control and/or Customer Service teams. In particular, AliExpress may suspend your access to the Service for a reasonable period of time and after issuing a prior warning if You frequently provide manifestly illegal content. In such cases, and where the relevant electronic contact details are known to AliExpress, AliExpress will inform you with a statement of reasons and the possibilities for redress.

  

Please refer to Clause 5.3. ‘Breaches’ for the list of potential restrictions AliExpress may apply to your use of the Sites and the means AliExpress uses to moderate content on our Sites.

  

Some situations that may result in an Online Transaction being rejected or canceled include, without limitation, those where problems are identified by our credit and fraud control department, where AliExpress.com has reason to believe the Online Transaction is unauthorized, violates any law, rule or regulations or may otherwise subject AliExpress.com or any of our affiliates to liability.

  

Before authorizing the relevant Online Transaction to proceed and charge the buyer, or before carrying out the final decision on the refusal/rejection or cancellation of the Online Transaction, as the case may be, AliExpress.com may also require additional verifications or information for any Online Transaction, and you agree to provide such verifications and information to AliExpress.com upon request. Failure to submit these verifications and information when requested may result in the Online Transaction failing, in which case AliExpress.com is not responsible for such failure. For the avoidance of doubt, if AliExpress.com finally determines that such refused or cancelled Online Transaction was not in breach of this Contract, we will make the proper arrangements for such Online Transaction to be completed or reimbursed, depending on the circumstances of the transaction. AliExpress.com will not be liable for any losses or damages arising out of or in connection with the refusal or cancellation of the relevant Online Transaction and is allowed to make a determination on any dispute between you and the seller, including the remittance of the funds under an Online Transaction that are held by Alipay (as defined in clause 2.2 below) as instructed by AliExpress.com in accordance with this Contract and the [Alipay Services Agreement](https://global.alipay.com/docs/ac/Platform/sfe2r7).

**6.**  **Recommender system**  

  

**6.1 Personalized recommendations**

Our Sites use a recommender system. The information displayed on all web pages containing personalised recommendations and/or personalised ads is selected by this recommender system. The recommender system helps us determine which content and products to promote by selecting the content and products which are more likely to be interesting and relevant to You. To do so, we use the following information about You: your IP address and/or the indicated ship-to country (or the more specific shipping destination chosen), your search history and browsing history when visiting or using the AliExpress platform, information about your shopping behaviour on the platform (click, add to cart, add to wishlist, purchased products), and your member profile information (such as your age, city, interests, purchased amount). Based on the above information, we will extract your preferences to recommend to You products or services that may be of interest to You.  

  

**6.2 Canceling/modifying the content recommended to You**

When You first use the Sites and have not yet logged in, You will be asked to grant AliExpress the right to use cookies for our recommender system. If You refuse, AliExpress will not use your behavioural data and will not provide You with personalised recommendations. If you are logged in and want to choose which products or ads AliExpress should (or should not) recommend, You can modify or disable the main parameters described above by accessing your "Privacy Settings" in the "Buyer Center".

  

If there is no address indicated in your profile, we will assign a ship-to location to your visit based on the language subdomain you have accessed, your IP address or your previous browsing history, where available. We will then display product listings which can be shipped to this location and the corresponding prices. You can adjust the location setting by manually changing the ship-to address at any time by clicking on the "Flag" icon in the upper right corner of the official website or in your personal setting in the App. 

**6.3 Ranking of products in search results**  

  

When using the search function, or browsing certain channel pages (such as product categories), users can change the criteria used to rank the products, choosing among one of several options, in particular:

\- "Best match": highest relevance, mainly determined by an algorithm that takes into account several factors which may change over time. The factors in question cover the following four aspects:

1\. The quality of the product’s description (i.e., the better quality the product description, the higher its ranking in the search result).

2\. The pertinence of the relevant products in light of the keywords included in the buyers’ search requests (i.e., the more the description includes keywords entered by the user in his/her search query, the higher the product ends up in the search results).

3\. The conversion rate of the relevant products (i.e., products that are more frequently sold are ranked higher).

4\. Service capability (i.e., products that are more likely to be delivered quickly are listed higher in the results).

\- "Orders": according to the volume of orders, from the most ordered products to the least for that search query.

\- "Price": from highest to lowest price, or from lowest to highest.

You can sort products by best match, orders and prices as well as select additional search criteria in the proposed filters; this feature is not based on your profile. 

We may feature promoted products in the search result page, i.e. products which sellers pay to have displayed in certain search results. In such case, the paid-for search result(s) will be presented in a differentiated manner from the other results shown (in particular by indicating "Ad").

  

**7.**  **Information on product conformity**

  

Where AliExpress becomes aware that an illegal product has been offered by a seller to you, AliExpress shall inform you of the fact that the product is illegal, of the identity of the seller and of the means of redress. AliExpress will only provide such information insofar as we have your contact details for products purchased during at least six months before we become aware of the illegality. Where AliExpress does not have your contact details, the information will be made publicly available.

Such choice of governing law does not deprive You of the protection afforded by mandatory provisions in the laws of the EU/UK and the country of habitual residence, which means that you are entitled to any relevant rights and their exercise under EU/UK laws and the laws of the country of your habitual residence.

**13.2.**  **Dispute Resolution**

**13.2.1.2.**  **Submission of a Dispute to Alibaba Singapore.** If the dispute cannot be resolved through our Platform DR System, You may submit the dispute to us, and we will then have the power to make a determination for such dispute or to delegate or sub-contract such power to another party for determination. Upon receipt of a dispute, we will have the right to rely on our records and request either or both of you and seller to provide supporting documents. We will have the discretion, acting reasonably, to reject or receive any supporting document.

Further, we do not warrant that the supporting documents that the parties to the dispute submit will be true, complete or accurate. For the avoidance of doubt, Alibaba Singapore and our affiliates shall not be liable for any material which is untrue or misleading, and Alibaba Singapore (and our agents, affiliates, directors, officers and employees) shall be released and indemnified from all claims, demands, actions, proceedings, costs, expenses and damages (including without limitation any actual, special, incidental or consequential damages) arising out of or in connection with such dispute.

**13.2.1.3.**  **Submission of a Dispute to Arbitration.** If You are dissatisfied with our determination and except as otherwise stipulated under applicable law, You shall apply to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre ("HKIAC") for arbitration and notify Alibaba Singapore of such application within 20 calendar days after the date of receipt of our determination.

Further, in this case You and Seller will deemed to have waived any claim against Alibaba Singapore, Alipay and our affiliates and agents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, You can exercise your rights as European Union/European Economic Area/United Kingdom consumer under article 18 of the Brussels I Bis Regulation (OJ EU 2012 L351/1) or applicable UK regulations, and bring a claim regarding your statutory rights in the EU/EEA/UK country in which you live, generally in the courts of the place where you are domiciled.

If the court cannot do that, you and we agree to ask the court to remove that unenforceable part and still enforce the rest of this Contract.

**14.2.**  **No Waiver.**If we do not act to enforce a breach of this Contract, that does not mean that we have waived our right to enforce this Contract.
