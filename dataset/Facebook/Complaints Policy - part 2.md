------------------------

We will remove content when we find it goes against our terms or policies, including the [Facebook Community Standards](https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/?source=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcommunitystandards%2F) or [Instagram Community Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119). We know we don't always get it right when we decide whether to take action on content (including profiles, accounts, pages or groups). If you disagree with a content decision Meta has made on Facebook or Instagram there are a number of steps you can take.

* If you report content by others but we find the content does not go against our terms or policies, we will let you know. At that time, if you disagree with our decision to leave the content up, you will generally be able to request another review. We have a comprehensive system for processing appeals and decisions will be overturned where a review concludes that’s the appropriate outcome.
    

* If your Facebook or Instagram account has been disabled for violating our terms or policies such as the Facebook Community Standards, Instagram Community Guidelines, or [other Meta policies](https://transparency.fb.com/policies/other-policies): you'll see a message saying your account is disabled when you try to log in. If you think your account was disabled by mistake, you will generally be able to ask us to review the decision by logging into your Facebook or Instagram account and following the on-screen instructions.
    

* If we took action against content you posted for violating our terms or policies, such as the Facebook Community Standards, Instagram Community Guidelines or [other Meta policies](https://transparency.fb.com/policies/other-policies):
    

* If your content was taken down and you think it doesn't go against our terms or policies, you will generally be able to request another review. We’ll let you know the outcome of our review, and if we find we've made a mistake, your content will be restored. You can find more information [here](https://www.facebook.com/help/2090856331203011?helpref=faq_content) for Facebook and [here](https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/280908123309761/) for Instagram.
    
* If you believe an Ad you were running was incorrectly rejected, you can request a review of the decision. You can find more information [here](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/975570072950669?id=434838534925385).
    
* Products listed on Facebook and Instagram must comply with our Commerce Policies. If you are a seller and believe a product you listed was incorrectly rejected, you can request a review of the decision. You can find more information [here](https://www.facebook.com/policies_center/commerce/).
    
* You can submit an appeal when your content was taken down because it violates intellectual property rights (more information [here](https://www.facebook.com/help/1900735080058381/?helpref=related_articles) and [here](https://help.instagram.com/1445818549016877/)) and you think we made a mistake. This applies to both actions on trademark (more information [here](https://www.facebook.com/help/www/561080341172839?helpref=platform_switcher) and [here](https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/693680257839261), and copyright (more information [here](https://www.facebook.com/help/194353905193770/) and [here](https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/1417735471763678)) grounds.
    
* If your content’s distribution has been reduced in feed, you will generally be able to request another review. We’ll let you know the outcome of our review, and if we find we've made a mistake, your content distribution will be restored. You can find more information about content distribution guidelines [here](https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/features/approach-to-ranking/types-of-content-we-demote/).
    

**_If we have placed restrictions on your Facebook profile, Page, or group or your Instagram account:_**

* If we remove multiple pieces of content from your profile, Page, group or account within a short period of time for violating our terms or policies, we may place [a short-term restriction](https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/enforcement/taking-action/restricting-accounts) on your account. We sometimes make mistakes, however you will generally be able to request another review. We’ll let you know the outcome of our review, and if we find we've made a mistake, we will correct it.
    

* If we have restricted your account, you can see your history of violations, restrictions your account might have, and how long they’ll last, in your Account Status. If you manage a Page or a group, you can find similar information by looking at [Page Quality](https://www.facebook.com/help/1985220725104252?helpref=faq_content) or [Group Quality](https://www.facebook.com/community/using-key-groups-tools/understanding-group-quality/).
    

* We may apply Advertising restrictions when an advertiser doesn't follow our Meta Advertising Standards or other policies and terms. If you believe your Ad account, user account, Page or Business Account was incorrectly restricted, you can request a review of the decision. You can find more information [here](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/975570072950669?id=434838534925385).

**_If a fact-checker has labelled content you’ve posted on Facebook or Instagram:_**

* You'll receive a notification if you try to share a post that includes false information or have shared one in the past as identified by [independent fact-checkers](https://about.fb.com/news/2018/06/hard-questions-fact-checking/) who are [certified](https://ifcncodeofprinciples.poynter.org/?fbclid=IwAR1SHHQcRwdtlApcxTW1nHhVDGuTXgeEJ2eqjXVqfCYsFTGGV_v_hmULHsM) through the non-partisan International Fact-Checking Network to help identify and review false information. Facebook Page admins will also be notified if they share posts with false information.
    

* You may be able to dispute a fact-check rating for content you created on Facebook. You can find more information [here](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/997484867366026?id=673052479947730).

* If you’re a Page manager or group admin, you may be able to appeal a misinformation violation about content the Page or group shared if you corrected the content or if you think a fact check got something wrong. You can find more information [here](https://www.facebook.com/help/1516907808694890/?helpref=related_articles).
    

**_If we have restricted access to your content on the basis of local law:_**

* We will let you know if we restrict access to your content on the basis of local law in the jurisdiction where it is alleged to be unlawful. At that time, if you disagree with the restriction, you will generally be able to request a review. If you report content by others on the basis of local law but we take no action, we will let you know. At that time, if you disagree with our decision to leave the content up, you will generally be able to request another review. We have a comprehensive system for processing appeals and decisions will be overturned where a review concludes that’s the appropriate outcome.
    

**_Submission of abusive reports_**

* If you frequently submit reports that are abusive, we may suspend processing of the reports you submit, in line with our [Misuse Policy](https://transparency.fb.com/enforcement/taking-action/misuse-policy).
    

**_Other options if you disagree with a content decision Meta has made:_**

* If you have exhausted our existing processes outlined above, you may also be able to appeal to the [Oversight Board](https://transparency.fb.com/oversight/appealing-to-oversight-board/). Keep in mind that not all decisions are eligible for appeal to the [Oversight Board](https://transparency.fb.com/oversight/appealing-to-oversight-board/) and the board only selects a certain number of eligible appeals, so they may not choose yours to review.
    

* If you disagree with a content decision Meta has made on Facebook or Instagram and are a user in the EU, you can raise that decision with a certified out-of-court dispute settlement body in order to resolve the issue.
