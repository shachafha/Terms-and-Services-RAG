2.3. The Service functionally enables the User to receive the code of a map as it stands for the time the code is received to insert it in his or her website, blog, and mobile application. This function is available to the User only within websites or mobile applications freely and readily available to the general public. The function cannot be used for projects requiring payment or otherwise limiting access for third parties. The sign-up requirement shall not be deemed limiting access under this clause.

2.4. The Service functionally enables the User to automatically plot routes on the maps showing an optional route from the point of departure to the destination indicated by the User (hereinafter referred to as the "Route"). The routing does not modify source data and is only acceptable to make the Service convenient for the User.

The user shall independently and entirely bear all risks and responsibility for choosing the Route and following the chosen Route. Yandex does not guarantee the correctness, optimality, relevance and/or compliance of the Routes with traffic rules and shall not be responsible for the User's choice of the Route and the consequences of following it.

The color display of the road congestion level used in the Service shall not be an indication of the status of the road, the possibility of its free use, actual functioning and passability, and shall be only an indicator of an approximate degree of its congestion in the current period of time (green stands for “open”, yellow for “medium congestion”, and red for “high congestion”).

2.6. The Service may provide the User with the functionality for search and browsing of information on circulation of the public transport (hereinafter referred to as “the “Transport” mode”) on the map of a specific location. The information displayed when using the “Transport” mode is provided by the partners of the Service and/or received from open public sources and is for reference only, Yandex bears no responsibility for accuracy, relevance and reliability of the information provided, including routes and directions of the public transport, transport timetable as well as location of the public transport at a certain point on a map.

2.7. The Service uses items of intellectual property copyrighted to relevant right holders and information provided by its holders. All the right holders and holders of information are listed in cl. 5 hereof.

2.8. The Service uses recommendation technologies. When using technologies to provide recommendations, the Service collects, systematizes and analyzes information related to the preferences of Users.

_Why does Yandex.Maps use recommendation technologies?_

In Yandex.Maps, recommendations help you find relevant organizations on the map faster.

_What are recommendation technologies used for?_

The algorithm recommends organizations and addresses that are more likely to match the User’s search query.

_What data about User preferences does the Service use and where does it get it?_

The algorithm analyzes the following information about Users’ preferences received from them when using the service:

* User’s search requests
    
* map fragment that the User sees while searching for places or organizations, whether he or she zooms it in, or out
    
* User’s interactions with the list of organizations and addresses (viewing, selecting, etc.)
    
* data on interactions with cards of organizations (card opening, frequency, calls, etc.)
    
* information about a possible user visit to the organization, taking into account geolocation, if permitted by the User.
    

_How does the Service analyze the data and how does it generate recommendations?_

The algorithm learns on the frequency of searching for a particular organization, selecting and viewing organizations or ignoring them in the drop-down list, and other types of User interaction with the Service. Based on this data, the algorithm selects possible most relevant and interesting organizations for the User and then displays them first.

The algorithm recommends organizations to users that may be of interest to them. Such recommendations are based on hypotheses about possible visits to organizations (taking into account the geolocation, if permitted by the User) and search history. Recommended organizations stand out on maps and are visible even at a small scale (without zooming in).

In this way, the algorithm can recommend organizations both personally to a specific user and to all users in a certain area (if the organization is often searched for and visited).

_How can a User manage recommendations?_

If the User does not want to receive personal recommendations, he or she can delete the history of visiting organizations within his Profile of Yandex services. At the same time, the algorithm will continue to show the user recommendations that are common to all users in the area.
