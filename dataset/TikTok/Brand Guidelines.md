**What is Branded Content?**
----------------------------

Branded content (“**Branded Content**”) is content that promotes a third party brand or its products or services in exchange for payment or any other incentive.

Branded Content includes content which features or references:

* A product or service that has been gifted to you by (or on behalf of) a brand;
* A brand, product or service that you have been paid to post about (whether in the form of money or a gift);
* A product or service for which you will receive a commission on any sales (for instance, via an affiliate link or promotional code); or
* A brand that you have or have had a commercial relationship with, such as acting as a brand ambassador.

**Rules for posting Branded Content:**
--------------------------------------

* You are responsible for ensuring that any Branded Content that you post complies with all applicable laws and regulations. While the rules in this Branded Content Policy are intended to help you to comply with relevant laws and regulations, they are not exhaustive and you should be aware of any other applicable legal requirements.
* As well as following these rules when you post Branded Content, you must also comply with TikTok’s [Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-service) and [Community Guidelines](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines).
* To the extent that your Branded Content does not comply with any of these rules, we may remove the content or impose other restrictions.
* We may update these rules periodically (for instance, if we need to reflect any changes to applicable laws or regulations) and in some instances we may need to apply them to content you have already posted (for example, if a new law requires us to no longer display certain types of content).

**What do you need to do when you post Branded Content?**
---------------------------------------------------------

* When posting Branded Content, you must enable the commercial content disclosure toggle. This is accessible through the content disclosure settings when posting your video. See [here](https://support.tiktok.com/en/business-and-creator/creator-and-business-accounts/branded-content-on-tiktok) for information on how to enable the toggle. When you enable the toggle, and indicate that the content is posted on behalf of a third party, your content will be automatically labelled to indicate that it is Branded Content. In addition, where required by law, your content may be added to the TikTok [Commercial Content Library](https://library.tiktok.com/) (please note that, in some circumstances, TikTok may be required to ensure that Branded Content remains publicly available in the library even if the original content is deleted or altered).
* You must ensure that the product or service you are promoting is sufficiently clear, without requiring other users to access your profile page or any links. For instance, you should explicitly identify the product or service verbally and/or in the text caption.
* You must not make false, deceptive or misleading claims about the products or services.
* You must not post content promoting illegal products or services.
* You must not promote products or services relating to any of the **🚫**Prohibited Industries listed below.
* You should also be aware that, if you promote products or services subject to any of the Country-Specific Requirements listed [here](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/branded-content-policy-country-specific-requirements), or which are otherwise subject to additional legal requirements or restrictions in specific countries or regions, we may prevent the content from being accessed in the relevant countries, or apply other restrictions (such as specific age limits).
* In addition, you must not:

* use surreptitious or subliminal techniques;
* prejudice respect for human dignity;
* include or promote any discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, nationality, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation;
* encourage behaviour prejudicial to health or safety or which is grossly prejudicial to the protection of the environment;
* cause physical, mental or moral detriment to minors;
* directly exhort minors to buy or hire a product or service or directly encourage minors to persuade their parents or others to purchase goods or services being advertised; or
* exploit the special trust minors place in parents, teachers or other persons, or show minors in dangerous situations.
