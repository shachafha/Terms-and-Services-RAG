UGC on our site has not been verified or approved by us. Any views expressed by other users on our site do not represent our views or values.

6.2     You own your UGC. However, you must not commercially exploit it without consent. You need consent from us and, where relevant, anyone else who has intellectual property rights in the UGC (for example, the publisher of a game).

6.3.2    We or our affiliated companies may make it visible in other places like the PlayStation Network.

6.3.3    We and our affiliated companies may alter your UGC for various reasons, including to add your Online ID (or your real name if you choose to use it) so others know it is yours, to ensure it displays well on various devices and so on.

6.3.4    Others can interact with it and do things to it like comment on it, alter it, delete it or reshare it.

6.3.5.    We and our affiliated companies may:

6.3.5.1    license, sell and otherwise commercially exploit your UGC (for example, selling subscriptions to access your UGC alone or in combination with other UGC);

6.3.5.2    receive advertising revenue in connection with UGC;

6.3.5.3.   use your UGC in the promotion of products and services; and

6.3.5.4.   alter or delete your UGC where necessary to comply with the law or exercise our rights under these Terms of Use.

6.4.    We do not pay you for using your UGC as described in this clause 6.

**7\.       Code of Conduct**

7.1     You must follow our [PSN Code of Conduct](https://www.playstation.com/get-help/help-library/my-account/grief-reporting/community-code-of-conduct/) in all dealings with us and other users. When using this site, you should:

**√ Be inclusive.**

The site is for everyone, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, nationality, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability or any other attribute that people use to label others or divide communities.

**☒ Do not** use or promote hate speech**.**

**☒ Do not** threaten, harm, or alarm anyone.

**√ Be sensible. Obey the law.**

**☒ Do not** be vulgar or offensive.

**☒ Do not** encourage anyone to hurt themselves or someone else.

**☒ Do not** threaten, condone, perform or promote any illegal acts.

**☒ Do not** impersonate anyone else.

**☒ Do not** infringe anyone’s privacy or defame them.

**☒ Do not** infringe anyone’s intellectual property.

**√ Be patient and considerate. Be kind.**

Remember you were new once too. You can help make someone’s early gaming and community experiences good ones.

**√ Be respectful.**

We know you can’t all agree, all the time. Disagree respectfully or walk away.

**√ Be a team player.**

Help each other out. If you find a vulnerability in the site, the PSN or a product, tell us so we can fix it, keeping you, others and our company safer.

**☒ Do not** be disruptive.

**☒ Do not** cheat.

**☒ Do not** use any bugs, glitches, vulnerabilities or unintentional mechanics in the site, products or the PSN to get an advantage.

Things you say and do online affect other people and have real world consequences. Think before you post anything online. Beware that information you put online can spread and may be seen by people you didn’t expect would see it.

**√ Help us ensure PlayStation is the best place to play.**

Always use common sense and good manners. If you see someone else misbehaving:

**√** Report them to us using our contextual grief reporting tools. If you use the most proximate grief reporting tool, when you submit the report, you can send us applicable evidence to help us assess your report.  Of course, this means other people can grief report - you and your content too. For more information on grief reporting please visit www.playstation.com/safety.

**√** If you engage with them, stay calm and respectful. Lead by example and don’t breach these Terms yourself.

**√ Follow any specific Rules for each product.**
