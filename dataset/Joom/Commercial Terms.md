1\. Joom as a Marketplace and Merchant’s Agent
----------------------------------------------

1.1. Joom provides a platform for Merchants who comply with Joom’s policies and requirements to offer and sell certain items.

1.2. Joom acts as a commercial agent of a Merchant within the scope of powers, rights and authorities set in this Agreement, including the powers and rights to negotiate and conclude transactions between Merchants and customers on the Site, set the final price for the items listed on the Site (“Items”), issue invoices for such Items, and (at Joom’s sole discretion) assist Merchants in the receipt and processing of customer’s claims for refund and guarantee on behalf of Merchant.

Joom, as a commercial agent of Merchant, acts in Merchant’s name and at Merchant’s expense.

Joom does not act as a commercial agent for a customer.

1.3. Customer’s payment obligation to Merchant shall be deemed as performed upon receipt of customer’s payment by Joom (or its payment services provider, as applicable), and Joom via its payment services provider, as applicable, is responsible for remitting the funds to Merchants in the manner described in Joom’s and Merchant’s agreement with payment services provider. If Joom (via payment services provider) does not remit any such amounts to Merchant, Merchant will have the right to recourse only against Joom (its payment services provider, as applicable) and not the customer directly.

1.4. Merchant authorizes Joom as an agent of Merchant to assist Merchant in handling and resolving customer’s claims and complaints that relate to refunds and guarantee in accordance with the policies set by Joom and/or PSP. For this purpose, Merchants shall be obliged to reply to Joom’s support agents and provide any necessary information that may be important for the case within 48 hours, but in any case, not later than within 5 calendar days. All the payments owed to Merchant shall be made by deducting or withholding the amounts of refund, compensation and other fees determined by Joom.

1.5. Merchant authorizes Joom to proceed with refunds, on the Merchant’s expense to customers when deemed necessary in customer claims, as a result of a violation of any applicable legislation or Joom’s terms and policies, even without receipt of any customer claim. Merchant agreed to cooperate and agree to Joom’s decisions on refunds in accordance with the applicable law and company’s policies and Joom shall notify Merchant of the result and reserves the right to final explanation.

1.6. Notwithstanding the above mentioned in clause 1.2, Joom has no control over the quality, safety, morality or legality of any aspect of Items, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of Merchants to sell Items or the ability of customers to pay for Items.

Joom reserves the right to refuse Merchant’s application in the following cases:

* Absence of registration documents requested by Joom. To be admitted to the Site the Merchant shall be a legal entity or an entrepreneur properly registered in one of the European Union countries, in the United Kingdom or in Norway as such legal entity or entrepreneur and shall be properly registered for VAT purposes in the country of its principal place of business and/or, where applicable and required, in the country of destination (i.e. the country of customer’s residence).
* Merchant’s product listing contains products either generally prohibited on Joom or prohibited and/or restricted for sale through the Site in the country of destination (i.e. the country from which the product can be ordered by the customer) and/or in the Merchant’s country. Please also refer to paragraph 3.
* Merchant has low ratings on other marketplaces (e-commerce platforms) or is not present on them at all.
* There are bad references from trusted sources.

Various government agencies publish lists, or descriptions, of such parties (“Denied Parties Lists”). In addition, many countries maintain trade sanctions and embargo programs against specific countries (“Sanctioned Countries”), such that unauthorized transactions involving these Sanctioned Countries or parties who are resident in those countries or have a connection to those countries are prohibited or restricted.

Additionally, Merchants must not do business with or otherwise engage in or facilitate transactions involving parties, services, and/or goods that are subject to sanctions or other applicable trade control restrictions. This includes, but is not limited to Denied Parties, parties that are owned or controlled by Denied Parties and parties who are residents in or connected with any country or region if any economic sanctions law that applies to Joom, a Merchant or to any Buyer if and to the extent that such laws prohibit the applicable transaction.

If the amounts due have not been paid due to any problems on the Merchant’s side (including, but not limited to incorrect payment details, change of the legal entity on the Merchant’s side that is non-compliant with Joom’s KYC requirements, any Joom’s terms and policies or any applicable legislation), Merchant shall contact Joom and provide Joom with the correct information as soon as possible.

If Joom finds out that there are any unpaid amounts that Merchant does not claim to be paid, Joom will inform the Merchant accordingly and send a notification letter via email or post. Merchant shall respond to such letter within 10 business days from the letter receipt, and either confirm the amount payable and provide Joom with any information that may be requested to execute the payment or provide Joom with evidence that the amount is not correct. If Merchant does not reply to the letter and does not contact Joom on this matter within 6 (six) months from the date of the letter or the Merchant is liquidated and none of its legal successors contact Joom, Joom reserves the right to write-off the unpaid amounts without any notification to Merchant.

6.11. Ordered Items shall be shipped by Merchants to customers at the Merchant’s expense within 4 business days after payment receipt date by Joom’s PSP.

In other cases, returns shall be made at the expense of the customer. All Items may be returned except for those Items which cannot be returned under the applicable laws and regulations of the country of destination. Merchant is obliged to indicate a full information with all necessary details for a return shipping and is liable for any losses caused by failure to meet these requirements.

Joom reserves the right to transfer products returned by customers to a third party chosen by Joom for utilization or further realization by such third party on any other platform apart from Joom’s one. In this case, Joom will act as your agent solely for the purpose of choosing and appointing such third party, while you agree that the title for the products will be transferred directly from you to such third party, and you will remain solely responsible and liable toward such third party and any its customers for any obligations related to the legality of the products, their compliance with any applicable legislation, presence or absence of any documents required, etc.

Joom had the right to moderate any Content Merchants submit for their listing on the Site, including new or edited Content related to Items listed on the Site, and any information related or connected to the Item submitted for listing, which is then displayed in product pages. This process is performed with the use of pre-defined parameters and automated tools such as automated text recognition software and rules and with involvement of the human review.

10\. Ranking. Recommender System Transparency. Promotional Activities
---------------------------------------------------------------------

10.1. Ranking of products in response to the customer’s search query and recommendations of items to customers depend on several factors and their various combinations, aimed at optimizing the search query results and recommendations for a particular customer. It is determined by an automated ranking and recommender algorithm. Ranking of products in response to the customer’s search query and recommendations of items to customers depend on several factors and their various combinations, aimed at optimizing the search query results and recommendations for a particular customer.

The main parameters used by the ranking algorithm are those that indicate the product’s relevance for a particular customer and are based on the overall product’s popularity among the Site’s customers. Such parameters vary depending on a particular customer’s history, search query wording, the relevance of products to such wording, etc. There is no exhaustive list of parameters as their number and degree of impact are different with regard to different customers. In other words, the more the product, its description, tags, rating, price, availability to a particular region (country of destination), etc. correspond to a customer, its history, preferences, search wording, etc., the more chances for such product to be on the top of the search query results. Product’s popularity is determined based on the set of criteria, including, but not limited to the number of orders, number of reviews and the product’s rating according to such reviews, product’s price, popularity and reliability of the product’s brand. The algorithm used for determining products popularity is dynamically updated and may change the prioritization of one criterion over others influencing product ranking on the Site.

Ranking of products is based not only on the popularity of the product as compared to all other products on the Site but also on their popularity within particular products categories. Popularity includes, for example, the number of views of a particular product, number of orders and number of reviews. For example, if there are no products with orders history in a product category or none of them has a review, the algorithm will use other criteria to determine prioritization between the products within such category (such as brand, product’s price, etc.). Popularity includes, for example, number of views of a particular product, number of orders and number of reviews.

To understand better what parameters can affect your products’ ranking, please find below examples of parameters used by the ranking algorithm to determine which products correspond to a search result most:

* Wording of the query: products containing the words corresponding to the search query will be prioritized and will appear among the search query results more frequently.
* Product’s category: products from the category with the name corresponding to the query wording most will be prioritized among the search results.
* Product’s name, description and tags: products with names, words in descriptions and tags assigned by merchants corresponding to the query wording most will be prioritized.
* Merchant’s store name and the brand name: the degree of matching the search query wording with the names of the store and the brand, and the popularity of the store and the brand affect the search query results.
* Quality (such as relevance and clarity) of the information on the product provided by the Merchant and its level of detail.

The accurate and complete product description, the clear and full name of the product, product’s photos of high quality among other factors may lead to the increase in the product’s card views by the customers and, therefore, may affect the frequency of the product’s appearance among the search query results. In particular, all the above-mentioned factors may affect the frequency of the product’s card access by the customers, while the frequency of such access and the number of times customers add a particular product to saved items or a product card in their turn increase the frequency of appearance of such item in the relevant searching results.

Products promoted via Joom Ads (as defined below) may constitute approximately up to 30 percent of search results. The certain proportions vary depending on the search query and the number of products on the Site corresponding to the query.

10.2. There is a section on the main page on the website version of the Site as well as in the app version, which contains the set of products that are shown to a customer prior to or without any search query. Products are chosen to such section on the Site by the automated algorithm as well.

The first and main set of rules used by the algorithm to choose products to be shown to a customer in such section can be described by three main groups of products that will be chosen by the algorithm:

* Products to be chosen to the section shall have reviews from the customers. This part will also include the products from stores that have Top Store status (please refer to the relevant section of the Merchant Help Center to familiarize yourself with the Top Store functionality and criteria). The proportion between products with reviews and products from Top Stores will depend on a customer’s region (for example, not every merchant having Top Store status can deliver products to a particular customer’s country), customer’s history on the Site, etc.
* Products promoted via Joom Ads will consist approximately up to 30 per cent of all number of products visible in the section.
* Randomly chosen products will also be included in the section. The randomness of such selection means that the algorithm will freely choose the products to be shown among all the products that are available to a particular customer, even if such products do not have views, reviews, etc.

As soon as the set of products is composed using the above criteria, the following criteria are used by the algorithm to adapt the section to a particular customer:

* Whether a particular product can be delivered to the customer’s country.
* Merchant’s performance in a customer’s country (rate of cancellations of orders, rate (number) of returns, etc).
* Customer’s preferences (i.e. previous interactions of a customer with products, products categories, etc.).

Please note that the algorithm is created and set in such a manner that will be intended on showing products that are the most relevant to a particular customer.

10.3. There are certain promotional instruments available to the Merchant, the information on which can be found in the Merchant Help Center, such as special promotions, daily promotions, and Joom Ads (Joom Ads Terms of Service with detailed information about the tool available at https://merchant.joom.com/ads-terms/). The Merchant’s products participating in the promotions will appear in the search query results among other products satisfying the above-mentioned criteria (i.e. they match the search query wording, etc.), and, will be automatically prioritized over the products not participating in the promotions. Besides, the Merchant’s products participating in the promotions will be shown in the relevant search query results being supplemented by the standard discount badge or the “SALE” discount badge.

Please refer to the relevant sections of the Merchant Help Center to be sure that you are aware of the most up-to-date information on promotional instruments and the way the Merchant can use them.

10.4. When you place the product offers on the Site You agree that your products can be advertised via external marketing tools of third-party advertisers, including, but not limited to social network and search engines platforms.

Products advertised via external marketing channels are chosen by the algorithms using a set of different criteria such as product’s reviews, the number of orders of this product, the product’s price as compared to other identical or similar products, etc. In general, the more popular a particular product, the higher chances for it to be chosen by the algorithm for external advertising. For the targeted advertising, the history of a particular customer’s interaction with products on the Site predetermines the products to be advertised to such customers via advertising channels.

The algorithms automatically update the prioritization of products between themselves using the above-mentioned criteria that are dynamically and automatically updated. The more popular the particular product becomes, the higher chances that it will be chosen by the algorithm for external advertising. Please note that external advertisers have their own set of rules that may affect the visibility and frequency of appearance of a particular product or product category on the advertiser’s platform. Joom cannot influence the advertiser’s platform rules and advertising mechanisms, as the result, neither the number of Merchant’s products that will be accepted for promotion and visibility of Merchant’s products in the external marketing channels.

Joom reserves the right to use certain products and/or categories of products for external advertising tests purposes. Such tests are limited in time and/or market of destination and help Joom to estimate the efficiency of advertising tools regarding such product categories or items and improve internal algorithms.
