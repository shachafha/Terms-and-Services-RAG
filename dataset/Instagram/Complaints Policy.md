What to do if you don't think Instagram should have taken down your post

We remove content (example: post, comment, story) from Instagram when we find that it goes against our [Community Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119). Our Community Guidelines define what is and isn't allowed on Instagram, and they apply all over the world. They're designed to encourage expression and create a safe environment on Instagram.

We know we don't always get it right when we decide to remove a post. If your post was taken down and you think it doesn't go against our Community Guidelines, you can request a review in most circumstances. For some types of content, you can't request a review, but we're adding more options.

We use both technology and people around the globe to review content that we've been asked to look at again. Certain appeals may be prioritized for human review, which can limit the amount of requests we're able to look at. **Note:** Because of this, it may take up to 90 days to hear back from us about our decision, but your request may be closed before we can review it.

There are a few ways to ask us to review our decision. When you receive the notification about your violation to learn more about why your content was removed, tap **Ask for a review** at the bottom and follow the on-screen instructions. You can also request a review from [Account Status](https://help.instagram.com/338481628002750) or Support Inbox.

When you request a review, we'll take another look at the decision we made about your post.

Once you ask us to take another look, your content will be reviewed again by Instagram. Once we’ve made a decision, you’ll receive a push notification. If we find we've made a mistake, we'll let you know and your content will be reposted.

If you request a review and still don’t agree with our decision, you may be able to [appeal to the Oversight Board](https://help.instagram.com/675885993348720). Keep in mind that not all decisions are eligible for appeal to the Oversight Board and the board only selects a certain number of eligible appeals, so they may not choose yours to review. You can read more about the [board’s bylaws and structure on their website](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Bylaws_v6.pdf).
