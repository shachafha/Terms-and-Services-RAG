[](#1-introduction)1\. Introduction
-----------------------------------

Please read these Terms of Use (these "**Terms**") carefully as they govern your use of (which includes access to) Spotify's personalized services for streaming music and other content, including all of our websites and software applications that incorporate or link to these Terms (collectively, the "**Spotify Service**") and any music, videos, podcasts, audiobooks, or other material that is made available through the Spotify Service (the "**Content**").

Use of the Spotify Service is subject to additional terms and conditions presented by Spotify, which are hereby incorporated by this reference into these Terms (collectively, the "**Agreements**"). Please refer to Section 7 below for information about those additional terms and how we may change these Terms or the additional terms incorporated by reference. To learn more about how Spotify collects, uses, shares and protects your personal data, please see the [Spotify Privacy Policy](https://www.spotify.com/legal/privacy-policy/).

By signing up for, or otherwise using, the Spotify Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, then you must not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.

#### [](#service-provider)**Service Provider**

These Terms are between you and Spotify AB, Regeringsgatan 19, 111 53, Stockholm, Sweden.

#### [](#age-and-eligibility-requirements)**Age and eligibility requirements**

In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 13 years of age (or the equivalent minimum age in your home country) or older, (2) have parent or guardian consent if you are a minor in your home country, (3) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (4) reside in a country where the Service is available. You also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times. If you are a minor in your home country, your parent or guardian will need to enter into these Terms on your behalf. You can find additional information regarding minimum age requirements in the registration process. If you do not meet the minimum age requirements then you should not register as a user. In certain markets, Spotify may offer primary account holders the opportunity to allow access to a kids experience as part of a family subscription. By enabling such access, the primary account holder confirms they are the legal guardian of any user accessing the experience and that they give permission for the younger user to use Spotify.

[](#2-the-spotify-service-provided-by-us)2\. The Spotify Service Provided by Us
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### [](#spotify-service-options)**Spotify Service Options**

We provide numerous Spotify Service options. Certain Spotify Service options are provided free-of-charge, while other options require payment before they can be accessed (the "**Paid Subscriptions**"). We may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services. We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.

#### [](#trials)**Trials**

From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a "**Trial**"). By using a Spotify Service via a Trial, you must agree to the [Spotify Premium Promotional Terms](https://www.spotify.com/legal/premium-promotional-offer-terms/).

#### [](#third-party-applications-devices-and-open-source-software)**Third-Party Applications, Devices and Open Source Software**

The Spotify Service may be integrated with, or may otherwise interact with, third-party applications, websites, and services ("**Third-Party Applications**") and third-party personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers, and other devices ("**Devices**"). Your use of such Third-Party Applications and Devices may be subject to additional terms, conditions and policies provided to you by the applicable third party.

#### [](#service-limitations-and-modifications)**Service Limitations and Modifications**

We use reasonable care and skill to keep the Spotify Service operational and to provide you with a personalized, immersive audio experience. However, our service offerings and their availability may change from time to time and subject to applicable laws, without liability to you; for example:

* The Spotify Service may experience temporary interruptions due to technical difficulties, maintenance or testing, or updates, including those required to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements.
* We aim to evolve and improve our Services constantly, and we may modify, suspend, or stop (permanently or temporarily) providing all or part of the Spotify Service (including particular functions, features, subscription plans and promotional offerings).
* Our dynamic content offering is constantly evolving and adapting to the needs of the Spotify community. Spotify has no obligation to provide any specific content through the Spotify Service, and Spotify or the applicable owners may remove access to particular songs, videos, podcasts, audiobooks and other Content without notice.

Your right to terminate these Terms if you no longer want to use the Spotify Service is set forth in Section 6 below.

If you have prepaid fees directly to Spotify for a Paid Subscription that Spotify discontinues prior to the end of your Pre-Paid Period (as that term is defined in the Payments and cancellations section below), Spotify will refund you the prepaid fees for the Pre-Paid Period for any unused part of your then current Paid Subscription after such discontinuation. Your account and billing information must be up to date in order for us to refund you.

Spotify has no liability to you, nor any obligation to provide a refund to you, in connection with internet or other service outages or failures that are caused by the actions of government authorities, other third parties or events beyond our control.

[](#3-your-use-of-the-spotify-service)3\. Your Use of the Spotify Service

#### [](#creating-a-spotify-account)**Creating a Spotify account**

You understand that you are responsible for all use (including any unauthorized use) of your username and password. Notify our Customer Service team immediately if your username or password is lost or stolen, or if you believe there has been unauthorized access to your account.

#### [](#your-rights-to-use-the-spotify-service)**Your rights to use the Spotify Service**

Access to the Spotify Service

Subject to your compliance with these Terms (including any other applicable terms and conditions), we grant to you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Spotify Service and the Content (collectively, "**Access**"). This Access shall remain in effect unless and until terminated by you or Spotify. You agree that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.

The Spotify software applications and the Content are licensed, not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your Devices.

Spotify's Proprietary Rights

The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors. All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand ("**Spotify Brand Features**") are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors. These Terms do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.

You agree to abide by the [Spotify User Guidelines](https://www.spotify.com/legal/user-guidelines/) and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by these Terms.

#### [](#payments-and-cancellation)**Payments and cancellation**

Paid Subscriptions

You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by:

* paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase; or
* pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period ("**Pre-Paid Period**").

Tax rates are calculated based on the information you provide and the applicable rate at the time of your monthly charge.

If you purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party, separate terms and conditions with such third party may apply to your use of the Spotify Service in addition to these Terms. If you purchase a Paid Subscription using a code, gift card, pre-paid offer, or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription ("**Codes**"), you must agree to the Spotify [Card Terms](https://www.spotify.com/legal/gift-card/).

Price and tax changes

Spotify may from time to time change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes (defined above), to reflect circumstances such as changes in product offerings and features, changes in the business or changes in the economic context, or for security, legal or regulatory reasons by communicating by any reasonable means, including by email or via in-app notification or otherwise, any price changes with reasonable notice, in any case not less than 30 days. Price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. Subject to applicable law, by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect, you will have accepted the new price. If you do not agree to a price change, you can reject the change by unsubscribing from the applicable Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.

Tax rates are based on the rates applicable at the time of your monthly charge. These amounts can change over time with local tax requirements in your country, state, territory or even city. Any change in Tax rate will be automatically applied based on the account information you provide.

Billing and Cancellation

Unless otherwise indicated (for example, if you have signed up for a Prepaid Period), Paid Subscriptions continue indefinitely until cancelled. You will be billed on a recurring basis on the first day of each billing period and you will pay and you authorise us (or the applicable third party, if you sign up through a third party) to charge your payment method the then-current subscription fee.

You may cancel your Paid Subscription at any time by logging into your Spotify account and following the prompts on the Account page or by clicking [here](https://support.spotify.com/article/cancel-premium/?_gl=1*2y9g6z*_gcl_au*MTkyNDM5MjI3My4xNzAxNzEwMzMz) and following the instructions. Unless otherwise indicated, cancellation will take effect from the end of the billing period in which you cancel and you will be downgraded to the free version of the Spotify Service. We do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods, except as expressly stated in these Terms.

If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Spotify Service.

In addition to, and notwithstanding, any other rights we may have under these Terms, we reserve the right to terminate a Paid Subscription at any time, on no less than 14 days' notice to you. Unless we inform you otherwise, we will allow you to retain access to the Paid Subscription for the remainder of the then-current billing period, after which we will downgrade your account to the free version of the Spotify Service.

#### [](#withdrawal-right)**Withdrawal right**

If you sign up for a Trial, you agree that the withdrawal right for the Paid Subscription for which you are receiving a Trial ends fourteen (14) days after you start the Trial. If you don't cancel the Paid Subscription before the Trial ends, you lose your right of withdrawal and authorise Spotify to automatically charge you the agreed price each month until you cancel the Paid Subscription. For trials less than fourteen (14) days, you expressly consent to us providing you with the paid service immediately after the end of your Trial and that from that point you lose your right of withdrawal.

If you purchase a Paid Subscription with no Trial, you agree you have fourteen (14) days after your purchase to withdraw for any reason and must pay us for the services provided up until the time you tell us that you have changed your mind. You expressly consent to us providing you with the service immediately following your purchase, that you lose your right of withdrawal, and authorise Spotify to charge you automatically each month until you cancel.

Further, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the courts listed below to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them), except where under applicable mandatory laws, you can choose to bring legal proceedings in your country of residence, or we are required to only bring legal proceedings in your country of residence

You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. There may be more limited discovery than in court. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. This arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.

#### [](#632-exceptions)**6.3.2 Exceptions**

Notwithstanding clause 6.3.1 above, you and Spotify both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a small claims court ,(2) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (3) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (4) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.

#### [](#633-arbitration-rules)**6.3.3 Arbitration rules**

Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings. Any arbitration between you and Spotify will be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the "ICC") then in force (the "ICC Rules") by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the ICC Rules, as modified by these Agreements, and will be administered by the International Court of Arbitration of the ICC.

Any arbitration will be conducted in the English language and unless otherwise required by a mandatory law of a member state of the European Union or any other jurisdiction, the law to be applied in any arbitration shall be the law of the relevant state or country described in clause 6.1, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.

#### [](#634-time-for-filing)**6.3.4 Time for filing**

Any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration within ONE (1) YEAR after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission, or default giving rise to the claim; and there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period. If applicable law prohibits a one-year limitation period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law.

#### [](#635-notice-process)**6.3.5 Notice; Process**

A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("**Notice**"). Spotify's address for Notice is: Spotify, Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA. The Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth the specific relief sought ("**Demand**"). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Spotify shall pay you (1) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (2) the last written settlement amount offered by Spotify in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator's award; or (3) $1,000.00, whichever is greater. All documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator's decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law. Except as required to enforce the arbitrator's decision and award, neither you nor Spotify shall make any public announcement or public comment or originate any publicity concerning the arbitration, including, but not limited to, the fact that the parties are in dispute, the existence of the arbitration, or any decision or award of the arbitrator.

#### [](#636-modifications)**6.3.6 Modifications**

In the event that Spotify makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to Spotify's address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Spotify's address for Notice, in which case your account with Spotify shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, shall survive.

#### [](#637-enforceability)**6.3.7 Enforceability**

If the class action waiver at Section 6.2 is found to be unenforceable in arbitration or if any part of this Section 6.3 is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 6.3 shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 6.1 shall govern any action arising out of or related to the Agreements and you shall not be prevented from bringing proceedings at any time.
