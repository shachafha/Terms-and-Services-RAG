      "Answer: Bazaraki allows ads for properties located only within the Republic of Cyprus. They act as an advertising platform and are not a licensed real estate agent, meaning they do not assist with any transactions related to real estate. Only owners of real estate, developers, agents, legal representatives of owners with a Power of Attorney, and first-degree relatives of owners can list real estate on Bazaraki. Bazaraki is not obligated to review or control any person or organization posting ads on their platform. They do not arrange viewings for listed properties and the information provided is purely for informational purposes, not constituting an offer or invitation to sell or rent real estate. Additionally, Bazaraki may, at their discretion, remove or decline to display any information or ad that does not comply with their terms and conditions. They may require the information to be amended if they believe a user is in breach of the terms or applicable law. Bazaraki reserves the right to charge additional fees for listings if they believe an ad is in breach of their terms. Lastly, Bazaraki does not monitor or censor the information or ads posted on their platform and is not responsible for any errors or omissions in the provided information. \n"

Hosts are expected to acquire and maintain insurance for themselves, their team, and their experience with the coverage and amounts specified by Airbnb. Hosts must cooperate with Airbnb to verify their insurance coverage. If Airbnb has its own liability insurance covering Experiences, the host's insurance will be the primary source of coverage, and Airbnb's insurance will function as excess or secondary insurance for amounts exceeding the host's coverage. However, procuring secondary insurance by Airbnb does not relieve hosts of their obligation to obtain insurance in amounts required by the company. \n"
