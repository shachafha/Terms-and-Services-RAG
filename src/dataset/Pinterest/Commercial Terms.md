Our mission

Our mission at Pinterest is to bring everyone the inspiration to create the life they love. We believe promoted content can play a big role in helping people create a life they love, which is why we want ads to be some of the best stuff you see on Pinterest. If you follow these guidelines, you’ll be all set for promoting great content on Pinterest.

Be authentic with your audience

Authenticity means being truthful and honest about the product or service you're promoting. It also means being transparent with people about what they should expect when they interact with your products or services.

Be honest about your relationship with Pinterest

Your ads should stick to our brand guidelines and shouldn't suggest that Pinterest is sponsoring your promotion or is formally affiliated with it. Basically, your design should look like it came from your business, not from Pinterest. You can use the word "Pinterest," but not our wordmark.

Disclose your billing practices

If you charge users on a recurring basis, be transparent with them and disclose the terms of payment.

Respect the rights of others

Your ads can't infringe upon or violate the rights of any third party, including copyright, trademark or privacy rights.

Be respectful with your targeting

Make sure your targeting is relevant and follow all the below guidelines.

Don't target sensitive categories

Targeting certain audiences can be inappropriate and offensive. It's never okay to target people in a way that implies you're aware of sensitive info about them. You can't target any audience based on:

* Sensitive health or medical condition
* Race, color or ethnic origin
* Personal hardship, including financial, physical and emotional hardship
* Religious or philosophical beliefs or affiliation
* Sexual behavior, orientation, or gender identity
* Alleged or actual commission of a crime
* Trade union membership or affiliation
* Political affiliation and opinions 
* Additionally, you can’t target ads to Pinners under 18 years old

Please note that the targeting of proxies for the sensitive categories above is also not allowed.

Protected groups

Some ad categories have additional targeting restrictions. In addition to the sensitive targeting guidelines, ads in the following categories can’t use actalike, age, gender or postal code targeting options or exclude Protected groups:

* Credit: Ads promoting credit products like credit cards, mortgages and loans.
* Employment: Ads promoting employment opportunities, including full -time jobs, part -time jobs, and work from home jobs.
* Housing: Ads promoting the purchase, sale, or rental of land or homes.

Keep in mind that age, gender, and familial status are protected, in addition to certain groups for which Pinterest prohibits targeting generally. Ads in these categories using prohibited targeting criteria will not be allowed to run. Ads in these categories that target both prohibited and non-prohibited keywords and/or interests may be approved but will not serve on any prohibited targeting criteria.

Be careful with any data usage

When using data to target or measure ads on Pinterest, you must follow our Ad Data Terms and, if applicable, our Lead Ad Terms. This applies to features like our tag, audiences, and app install campaigns.

Follow all measurement and audience targeting rules

Anywhere you collect data used with a Pinterest ads service, you must disclose and get legally-required consent from each individual for that data collection, sharing and use.

If you use the Pinterest tag or send us mobile app activity, you must tell your website and app visitors that their information will be shared with third parties for online behavioral advertising, and that they can opt out of online behavioral advertising through their Pinterest personalization settings, the AdChoices website optout.aboutads.info (if you use the Pinterest tag), or their mobile ad identifier settings (if you share app activity data with us). Don’t give us information that relates to sensitive categories—like medical condition or ethnic origin—or that’s collected from a child-directed site or app, or from anyone who’s under 13 or the legal age of consent in your country (if higher). Only pass us user identifiers (like Mobile Ad IDs or hashed emails) in designated fields and according to our documentation.

Do not send Pinterest customer lists that are based on user activity from an app or website on an iOS device. Do not send Pinterest information about any individual who has exercised an option to opt out of having such data used for targeted advertising purposes.

Respect our community's data and privacy

For all Pinterest ads services:

You can't:

* Use data you collect or receive through a Pinterest ads service for any purpose (including audience targeting or user profiling) other than to understand your Pinterest campaigns, and only on an anonymous basis
* Share data from a Pinterest ads service with a third party, including another advertising service
* Join data from a Pinterest ads service with personally identifiable information (like an email address) or information that identifies a user, browser, or device (like a cookie or mobile ad identifier)

If you receive any data from Pinterest tied to a unique identifier (e.g., campaign reporting data linked to a mobile device ID) then you can’t use it to market products or services, or for any purpose besides measuring Pinterest campaigns,  and you must delete it no later than 6 months after receiving it.

Advertisers using ad products that ask for user information have to follow all advertising guidelines.

Advertisers must have a legitimate business reason for collecting the data, respecting the data minimization principle. Asking for home address and date of birth is allowed with restrictions.

In addition, advertisers must not reference or ask via the Pinterest ads service for the following information related to sensitive categories:

* Sensitive health or medical condition, including related to genetics, fertility or pregnancy
* Race, color or ethnic origin
* Personal hardship, including financial, physical and emotional hardship
* Religious or philosophical beliefs or affiliation
* Sexual behavior or orientation
* Alleged or actual commission of a crime
* Trade union membership or affiliation
* Political affiliation or opinions
* Pinners under 18 years old
* Precise geolocation (e.g. GPS) 
* Account numbers, including frequent flyer numbers, loyalty card numbers, cable or telephone account numbers
* Financial information, including bank account numbers, bank routing number, credit or debit card numbers, tax number, credit score, bankruptcy status, income, net worth or how much debt someone has
* Government-issue identifiers, including social security numbers, passport numbers, driver license’s numbers or state identification cards
* Insurance information, including current insurance policy numbers or other details about a person’s insurance
* Usernames and passwords
* Citizen or immigration status
* Marital status
* Relationship status
* Military status

Advertisers should not collect personal data that is not covered in Pinterest Privacy Policy. If you are unclear whether certain information is covered under the Privacy Policy, please reach out to [privacy-legal@pinterest.com](mailto:privacy-legal@pinterest.com).

For Pinterest lead ads:

Advertisers promoting Pharmacy (Rx), Over-the-Counter (OTC) products, health-related apps (e.g., heart rate, weight), and/or Telehealth Services are prohibited from using lead ads.

Advertisers must have a legitimate business reason for collecting personal data from Pinners in a lead ad and must respect the data minimization principle (i.e. limit the collection of personal data to what is directly relevant and necessary to accomplish a specified purpose). For example:

* It is allowed to:
    * Ask for a Pinner’s date of birth or age to advertise an alcoholic beverage; or
    * Ask for a Pinner’s home address to mail product samples
* It is _not_ allowed to:
    * Ask for a Pinner’s date of birth and age. Age can be calculated with an Pinner’s date of birth, so collecting both data elements would not respect the data minimization principle; or
    * Ask for a Pinner’s home address to mail them disclosures, statements or invoices required in the event the Pinner becomes a customer of the advertiser. In this instance, the advertiser will have an opportunity to collect the Pinner’s home address when said Pinner becomes a customer of the advertiser

Advertisers must not ask via a lead ad for the following information:

* Sensitive health or medical condition, including related to genetics, fertility or pregnancy
* Race, color or ethnic origin
* Personal hardship, including financial, physical and emotional hardship
* Religious or philosophical beliefs or affiliation
* Sexual behavior or orientation
* Alleged or actual commission of a crime
* Trade union membership or affiliation
* Political affiliation or opinions
* Pinners under 18 years old
* Precise geolocation (e.g. GPS) 
* Account numbers, including frequent flyer numbers, loyalty card numbers, cable or telephone account numbers
* Financial information, including bank account numbers, bank routing number, credit or debit card numbers, tax number, credit score, bankruptcy status, income, net worth or how much debt someone has
* Government-issue identifiers, including social security numbers, passport numbers, driver license’s numbers or state identification cards
* Insurance information, including current insurance policy numbers or other details about a person’s insurance
* Usernames and passwords
* Citizen or immigration status
* Marital status
* Relationship status
* Military status

Be thoughtful with your editorial

To keep ads inspiring and actionable, we set high standards for the editorial quality of ads on Pinterest. For tips, check out our creative best practices and boards from The Studio.

Professional and neatly edited images

Ads should adhere to the highest levels of editorial quality. We don’t allow ads with:

* Fuzzy, blurry, or grainy images (try at least 600x900 pixels)
* Images with text that is too small or blurry to read
* Incorrectly oriented images (upside down or sideways)
* Poorly edited images or poorly cropped images 
* Overly busy images that are packed with text overlay or have too many font styles and colors (try no more than 4 frames and 2 font styles or colors)
* Images with artificial functionality like play or download buttons, notification icons, search bars, or elements that mimic Pinterest features (like our Save or Buy buttons)
* Elements that mimic Pinterest features (like our buttons or ellipses)
* Improper grammar, incorrect spelling or excessive capitalization and symbols
* Low-quality user-generated content like selfies and screenshots
* Ads with flashing or strobing effectsQuality landing pages

We care about the ad experience from start to finish—including the URL your ad links to. We want to make sure users find what they're looking for when they click through. We don’t allow landing pages that:

* Require people to take an action (like signing up) before they can see certain content unless your ad makes it clear that this is required
* Have pop-up ads or start automatic downloads on someone’s device
* Force people to visit another page
* Contain primarily advertising content (made-for-ads sites)
* Lead to inconsistent experiencesCreate a consistent experience

Your ads must reflect who you are and what you're promoting, so make sure your ad image, description and landing page are consistent. Your ads can't suggest or imply that a product is available on your landing page if you don't actually offer that product.

Be responsible with your content

We don’t allow certain categories of advertising and restrict others. As always, you're responsible for the content you promote on Pinterest, as well as the safety and trustworthiness of the products and services you offer.

Prohibited content guidelines

Adult and nudity content

We don’t allow the advertising of:

We also don't allow:

* Nudity or implied nudity (such as blurred out images and illustrations)
* Implied sexual activity (clothed or unclothed)

You can advertise modeled clothing such as bathing suits and lingerie, as long as the products aren't adult-themed or overtly sexual. However, we don’t allow any imagery featuring minors in underwear and we don't allow imagery featuring minors in swimsuits unless accompanied by adults in the image.
