How to appeal to the Oversight Board
====================================

UPDATED

APR 3, 2024


------------------------

If you disagree with a content decision Meta has made on Facebook, Instagram, or Threads, you can appeal the decision to the Oversight Board. After going through Meta’s appeals process, you’ll be issued an Oversight Board reference number, which you can use to submit your case to the board for review.

##### What you can appeal

Here’s what you can appeal to the board:

* Most content you posted on Facebook, Instagram, or Threads that has been taken down.
    
* Most content posted by another person that has been left up on Facebook, Instagram, or Threads.

### Appeal steps

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/yR/r/lz1K8YbpVaR.svg)1\. Obtain an Oversight Board reference number

To obtain a reference ID, you must have already exhausted Meta’s appeals process and received a final content decision from Meta. You’ll then receive a message in your Support Inbox on Facebook or Support Requests on Instagram that will include a reference number. The support requests for Instagram and Threads are the same. If your appeal originated from Threads, you can check your support request message on both apps.

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/yR/r/lz1K8YbpVaR.svg)2\. Log in to Oversightboard.com

Visit the board’s website, and navigate to Start an Appeal. Log in with Facebook, Instagram, or Threads, depending on which app you received the reference number from.

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/yR/r/lz1K8YbpVaR.svg)3\. Enter the reference number

Enter the reference number so the board can:

* Verify the post is eligible for submission.
    
* Establish a link between Meta and the board’s case management system so board staff and members can access and review the correct post and related case information.
    

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/yR/r/lz1K8YbpVaR.svg)4\. Consent

You’ll be asked for various permissions in the case management system:

* You **must agree** to the Terms of Service to submit an appeal.
    
* You **must give** permission to process any data with special protections that you choose to provide about yourself.
    
* You **can choose** whether or not to consent to the board including details that could easily identify you in their public decision.
    
* You **can choose** whether or not to consent to the board including data with special protections in the published decision as well.
    

If you later wish to withdraw the consents provided about what the board can include about you in the published decision, you can do so in the Case Status page.

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/yR/r/lz1K8YbpVaR.svg)5\. Provide context on the case

You’ll have an opportunity to provide more information on your appeal, including why you posted the content, why you’re appealing Meta’s decision and how you think Meta got the decision wrong.

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/yR/r/lz1K8YbpVaR.svg)6\. Review and submit the case

Review all the information you’ve entered, including the consents provided, and click submit. After submission, you’ll be able to review the information you submitted and withdraw consents, if you wish. You’ll also be able to delete the entire case.

You can check for updates on the case in the Case Status page on the Oversight Board’s website.

### Case timelines

The board selects cases from among those referred to it by people who use Facebook, Instagram, or Threads, or by Meta itself. The board has the sole discretion as to which cases to hear, except in exceptional circumstances when Meta refers a case for expedited review, where the board will accept and review the case as quickly as possible.

Not all content decisions are eligible for appeal to the board. If a Meta content decision is eligible for review, you'll see an Oversight Board reference ID within your Support Inbox.

Once you submit the appeal, the board will decide whether or not to review it. The board only selects a certain number of eligible appeals to review, so they may not choose yours.
