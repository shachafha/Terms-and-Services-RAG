Misuse Policy
=============

UPDATED

APR 16, 2024


-------------------------

We have a robust process for taking action against [content](https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/enforcement/taking-action/counting-strikes/) and [accounts](https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/enforcement/taking-action/restricting-accounts) on Facebook or Instagram that go against our [content policies](https://transparency.fb.com/enforcement/taking-action/applying-content-policies). Where content is illegal or we determine certain behaviours by users or individuals constitute the following types of misuse, we may also take action:

* We may suspend, for a limited period of time, users who, after being warned, repeatedly post manifestly illegal content. This does not preclude us from terminating your use of the service under Art 4.2 of the Facebook Terms of Service or as set out in the “Content Removal and Disabling or Terminating Your Account” section of the Instagram Terms of Use.
    
* The decision to suspend access, and for how long, will depend on factors such as the nature and severity of the illegal content, the history of the user’s behavior on Facebook or Instagram, including the amount of manifestly illegal content posted, and, if identifiable, the intent of the user.
    
* We may suspend the processing of reports submitted through our reporting mechanisms, for a limited period of time, where individuals and entities have, after being warned, frequently submitted reports that are abusive.
    
* The decision to suspend the processing of reports, and for how long, will depend on factors such as the nature and severity of the abusive reports (for example, submission of multiple reports, without any new information, against the same piece of content, despite confirmation that it is not clear to us that the content is unlawful) and the individual or entity’s history of submitting reports on Facebook or Instagram that are abusive (including the amount and proportion of abusive reports), and, if identifiable, the intent of the individual or entity.
