1               Your Relationship with Us 

1.1           These TikTok For Business Commercial Terms of Service (these “**Commercial Terms**”) govern your use of TikTok’s products and/or services, in connection with your TikTok For Business, TikTok Ads Manager or TikTok Business Center accounts (“**Commercial Products**”). Commercial Products also include any other TikTok products and/or services, where you accept these Commercial Terms as a condition of access or use. These Commercial Terms form a legally binding contract between you and TikTok. 

1.2           For purposes of these Commercial Terms only, and unless otherwise specified:

 “**TikTok**”, “**we**”, and “**us**” means either: 

●      TikTok Inc. (US), if you are based in North America;

●      TikTok Information Technologies UK Limited (UK), if you are based in the United Kingdom or Africa;

●      TikTok Technology Limited (Ireland), if you are based in the EEA or Switzerland; or

●      TikTok Pte. Ltd. (Singapore), if you are based in any other geographic area.

“**You**” or “**your**” means the entity or individual using the Commercial Products for its business or commercial purposes. 

1.3           Your use of the Commercial Products will constitute acceptance of these Commercial Terms. 

1.4           You must not use the Commercial Products unless you have full power and authority to enter into, and perform the obligations under, these Commercial Terms. 

1.5           You may use the Commercial Products only if you have reached the age of majority in your jurisdiction and can enter into a binding contract with us. 

1.6           If you are acting on behalf of a legal entity, you represent and warrant that the legal entity is an entity validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization.

1.7           If you are legally exempt from certain responsibilities, then those responsibilities may not apply to you under these Commercial Terms. For example, the United Nations enjoys certain immunities from legal obligations and as such, these Commercial Terms would not override those immunities. 

1.8           In these Commercial Terms, any phrase introduced by the terms “**including**”, “**include**”, “**in particular**”, “**for example**” or any similar expression is intended to be illustrative and not limit the words preceding those terms.

1.9           IF YOU ARE BASED IN THE UNITED STATES, THESE COMMERCIAL TERMS CONTAIN A MUTUAL ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND WAIVER OF RIGHTS TO BRING A CLASS ACTION.

If the dispute has not been resolved after the response time has expired, or within 30 days after a response has been issued, whichever is earlier, either party may initiate arbitration proceedings (or, to the extent permitted under this Arbitration Agreement, file court action) against the other. Engaging in this informal dispute resolution process is a requirement that must be completed before filing any legal action. You and TikTok agree that you both will make a good faith effort to resolve the dispute amicably before either you or TikTok files any legal action against the other, and that applicable statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process.

(b)            Arbitration and Class Action Waiver

(i)             Scope of Arbitration Agreement

The parties agree and acknowledge that this Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (“**FAA**”) will govern its interpretation and enforcement. 

The parties agree that after completing the informal dispute resolution process in Section 14.2(a), any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim relating to or arising out of your access to or use of the Commercial Products under these Commercial Terms, or the existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity of the Commercial Terms (“**Claims**”) will be resolved by binding individual arbitration, rather than by a court of law, except as otherwise provided below. If the parties’ dispute involves some arbitrable claims and some non-arbitrable claims, all non-arbitrable claims must be stayed until completion of the arbitration. This Arbitration Agreement shall apply to all Claims, including those that arose or were asserted before the effective date of this Arbitration Agreement. By agreeing to this Arbitration Agreement, you and TikTok expressly agree not to initiate or participate in any existing or future class, collective or representative actions against the other, as set forth in Section 15.2(b)(vi).

Notwithstanding any other provision in these Commercial Terms, this Arbitration Agreement will not require arbitration of the following types of claims: (a) small claims actions brought on an individual basis that are within the scope of such small claims court’s jurisdiction, (b) injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s confidentiality rights or copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights, and (c) claims not  subject to arbitration as a matter of generally applicable law, after accounting for FAA preemption. Additionally, to the extent a Claim seeks public injunctive relief that is found to be a cognizable claim, such Claim must be resolved by a court or law, and stayed pending the resolution of the arbitration of any related Claims.

To the extent the parties are permitted under this Arbitration Agreement to have a matter or Claim resolved by a court of law rather than in arbitration, you and TikTok agree that such matters or Claims shall be litigated exclusively in either the United States District Court for the Central District of California or the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles. You also agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such disputes.

(ii)            Arbitration Rules and Forum

The arbitration will be conducted by National Arbitration & Mediation (“**NAM**”) under its Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (and, if applicable, Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, as discussed below) and the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, a party must satisfy the requirements pursuant to NAM’s rules. The most current version of the NAM Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and the NAM Mass Filing Supplement Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures are available at [](https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/)[https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/](https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/). If NAM is unable to arbitrate the dispute for whatever reason, a court of competent jurisdiction shall appoint the arbitrator.

The payment of all filing, administration, and arbitration fees will be governed by the NAM Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (and, if applicable, Mass Filing Supplement Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures), except that (1) the prevailing party may seek attorneys’ fees, costs, and reimbursement of NAM filing and professional service fees if the arbitrator finds that the opposing party brought a claim, counterclaim, or defense that was either frivolous or brought with an improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of arbitration; and (2) if a party timely serves an offer of judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 (or its state law equivalent), and the judgment that the other party finally obtains is not more favorable than the unaccepted offer, then the other party shall pay the costs, including filing fees, incurred after the offer was made.

(iii)           Mass Filing and Bellwether Protocols

To increase efficiency of resolution, and subject to a decision by NAM to invoke its Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, the following protocol will apply if 100 or more similar arbitration demands are presented under these terms by or with the assistance of the same law firm or collection of law firms (“**Mass Filing**”). For the avoidance of doubt, NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures shall apply if the parties’ dispute is deemed by NAM, in its sole discretion pursuant to the NAM Rules and this Mutual Arbitration Provision, to be part of a Mass Filing.

Any Mass Filing shall be subject to bellwether protocols intended to reach a fair and speedy resolution of all claims included in the Mass Filing. In any Mass Filing, NAM shall randomly select four (4) demands for arbitration to proceed, and then claimants and respondents shall each select three (3) additional demands for arbitration to proceed -- for a total of ten (10) arbitrations (“**Bellwether Arbitrations**”). While the Bellwether Arbitrations are adjudicated, all other demands for arbitration that are part of the Mass Filing shall be held in abeyance and stayed, and no party shall be responsible for paying any administrator or arbitrator fees (other than NAM’s initial filing/administrative fees, and Procedural Arbitrator fees, if applicable) while the Bellwether Arbitrations are adjudicated. Any applicable statute of limitations regarding those demands shall remain tolled beginning when the Mass Filing claimant first provided the other party with notice of its intent to initiate informal dispute resolution, as discussed above.

The parties shall work in good faith with the arbitrator to complete each Bellwether Arbitration within 120 days of its initial pre-hearing conference.

The parties agree that these bellwether proceeding protocols are designed to achieve an overall faster, more efficient, and less costly mechanism for resolving Mass Filings, including claims that are not selected for Bellwether Arbitration.

Following the resolution of all of the Bellwether Arbitrations, the parties shall engage in a global mediation of all remaining demands for arbitration comprising the Mass Filing. The mediation shall be administered by NAM. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining demands for arbitration comprising the Mass Filing within 30 days following the mediation, the remaining demands for arbitration comprising the Mass Filing shall be administered by NAM pursuant to the provisions below regarding batching, along with NAM Rules and NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures.

If the parties are unavailable to achieve global resolution following the above Bellwether Arbitrations and global mediation, these batching provisions shall apply and NAM shall (i) consolidate the arbitration demands into batches of no more than 100 demands per batch; and (ii) provide for resolution of each batch as a single arbitration proceeding with one arbitrator assigned per batch. This batching process shall not impact the nature of these actions as individual in nature, including that the arbitrator will make a separate determination for each claimant, nor shall it change the burden of proof on each individual claimant. You and TikTok both agree to cooperate in good faith with each other and the arbitration provider to implement such a batch approach, including in working with NAM to request a different fee schedule from that set forth in NAM’s relevant rules and that is more favorable to You and TikTok. Any disagreement over the batch approach will be determined with all affected parties in a single, consolidated arbitration proceeding with one arbitrator subject to the requirements of this Section and NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures.

(iv)           Arbitrator Powers

The arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the scope, interpretation or enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement, except that a court of law has the exclusive authority to determine the enforceability of any part of the Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions provision in Section 14.2(b)(vi) of this Arbitration Agreement. All disputes regarding allocation of the arbitrator’s fees and / or the arbitration fees shall be determined exclusively by an arbitrator. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator will issue a written statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which any award (or decision not to render an award) is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The award shall be binding only among the parties and shall have no preclusive effect in any other arbitration or other proceeding involving a different party. The arbitrator shall follow the applicable law. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The arbitrator’s decision is final and binding on you and TikTok.

(v)            Waiver of Jury Trial

You and TikTok waive any rights to sue in court and receive a judge or jury trial, except as otherwise specified in this Arbitration Agreement.

(vi)           Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions

You and TikTok agree to waive any right to have Claims decided on a class, collective or representative basis, except as set forth in this Section 14.2(b)(vi) (“**Class Action Waiver**”). In any case in which (1) Claims are filed as a class, collective, or representative action and (2) a civil court of competent jurisdiction finds all or part of the Class Action Waiver unenforceable, the class, collective, and/or representative action must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction. This provision does not prevent you or TikTok from participating in a settlement on a class-wide, collective, or representative basis.

(vii)         Survival

This Arbitration Agreement will survive any termination of your relationship with TikTok.

(viii)        Severability

If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, then (i) the unenforceable or unlawful portion will be severed from this Arbitration Agreement, (ii) the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement will be given full force and effect, and (iii) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful portion will have no impact on the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining Claims on an individual basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, severance of any portion of the Class Action Waiver in Section 14.2(a)(vi) shall not be construed to permit you or TikTok to proceed with Claims in mass arbitration, to which the parties expressly do not consent.

(c)            ONE YEAR LIMITATION PERIOD / LIMITATION ON LEGAL ACTION

YOU AND TIKTOK AGREE THAT YOU MUST INITIATE ANY PROCEEDING OR ACTION WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OF THE DATE OF THE OCCURRENCE OF THE EVENT OR FACTS GIVING RISE TO A DISPUTE THAT IS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE COMMERCIAL TERMS.  OTHERWISE, YOU FOREVER WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION, OF ANY KIND OR CHARACTER, BASED ON SUCH EVENTS OR FACTS, AND SUCH CLAIM(S) OR CAUSE(S) OF ACTION ARE PERMANENTLY BARRED.

14.3        **Arbitration Agreement; Class Waiver – if you are based in the United Kingdom, EEA or Switzerland**

(a)            Class Action Waiver 

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you and TikTok acknowledge and agree that each is waiving the right to bring or participate in a class, collective, or consolidated proceeding against each other.

(b)            Exceptions to Mediation and Arbitration

Nothing in this Section 14.3 shall: (i) prevent TikTok from applying to any court or other judicial authority of competent jurisdiction for interim relief of any kind including, without limitation, injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's confidentiality rights or copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights; (ii) require either party to arbitrate claims that may not be subject to arbitration as a matter of generally applicable law (and the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction over such claims); or (iii) prevent either party from bringing a claim in a court of law where it has a legal right to do so without prior mediation and/or arbitration (as applicable), unless that legal right can be given up or changed by contractual agreement.

(c)            Procedure

If you are based in the United Kingdom, EEA or Switzerland, subject to the exceptions in Section 14.3(b), if you have any claim or dispute against TikTok arising out of or in connection with these Commercial Terms, including any question regarding its existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity, the parties shall follow the procedure set out in this Section 14.3(c): 

(i)             either party shall give to the other written notice of the dispute, setting out its nature and full particulars, together with relevant supporting documents, and the parties shall agree to attempt, promptly and in good faith, to resolve such dispute by way of confidential discussions between the parties. The notice of dispute to TikTok must be sent to Kaleidoscope, 4 Lindsey Street, London, United Kingdom, EC1A 9HP, Attn: Legal Department and will be deemed to have been received upon delivery. For the avoidance of doubt, this notice provision applies notwithstanding the general notice provisions in Section 15.9.

(A)           If the dispute has not been settled pursuant to Section 14.3(c)(i) within 30 days of the date the written notice under Section 14.3(c)(i) was deemed received, or within such other period as the parties may agree in writing, then the parties will refer the dispute to mediation under the International Chamber of Commerce (“**ICC**”) Mediation Rules or the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (“**CEDR**”) Model Mediation Procedure (as chosen by you). Unless otherwise agreed between the parties within 14 days of referral of the dispute, the mediator will be nominated by the ICC or CEDR (as applicable). 

(B)           If the dispute has not been settled pursuant to Section 14.3(c)(ii) within 60 days following the filing of a request for mediation or within such other period as the parties may agree in writing, such dispute will thereafter be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the ICC, which are incorporated by reference into this Section. 

(C)           Unless the parties agree otherwise, there will be one arbitrator (to be appointed by the ICC), the arbitration will take place in London, England, and the arbitration will be conducted in English.

14.4        **Arbitration Agreement - if you are based in the Republic of Indonesia** 

(a)            You and TikTok agree that if either party has any claims or disputes arising out of or in connection with these Commercial Terms, including any question regarding its existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity ("**Dispute**"), either party shall give to the other written notice of the Dispute, setting out its nature and full particulars, together with relevant supporting documents, and the parties shall agree to attempt, promptly and in good faith, to resolve such Dispute by way of confidential discussions between the parties.

The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Rules of BANI for the time being in force ("**Rules**"), which Rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this section except where such Rules conflict with the provisions of this section, in which event the provisions of this section shall prevail. The number of arbitrators will be three. The seat and venue of arbitration shall be Jakarta. The language of arbitration shall be English.

(d)   You and TikTok agree that the BANI arbitration award is final, binding and cannot be disputed by you or TikTok. You and TikTok hereby waive, to the fullest extent possible, any right to appeal or challenge any award, as well as any immunity or privilege that it may have in relation to the validity or enforceability of an arbitral award or any decision relating to the same. We and you also agree to waive the applicability of Article 48 of the Arbitration Law such that the arbitration needs to be completed within a specified timeframe.
