As an advertiser, you are responsible for ensuring that your keywords and ad content, including trademarks and logos, do not infringe or violate the intellectual property rights of others. We take allegations of trademark infringement seriously. Review our intellectual property policies below for details about trademarks, copyright, counterfeit goods and how to submit a complaint.

Please note that trademarks or other terms prone to nefarious tactics related to user safety may be proactively blocked to protect the network and our users. If your content is blocked for these terms, you may be asked to provide additional documentation/information upon appeal.

Trademark owner
---------------

If a trademark owner is concerned that their trademark is being used improperly in ad text, imagery, or landing page, the owner should first contact the advertiser directly to address the issue. If dissatisfied with the outcome, the owner may also wish to contact Microsoft by completing the [Intellectual Property Concern Form](https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/policies/intellectual-property-complaint-form) for that market and select the option “Trademark Misuse in Ad Copy.” See “Trademark infringement investigations” below for more details.

Please note that Microsoft is not a mediator. As such, Microsoft encourages trademark owners to engage directly with advertisers who they believe are misusing their trademarks.

Trademark infringement investigations
-------------------------------------

Microsoft will investigate a complaint about trademark infringement in the text of a search ad and will take appropriate action after it receives all required information. The investigation is designed to ensure the quality and accuracy of our ad results and to help our users avoid confusion.

* Microsoft allows the fair use of trademarks in ad text, such as:
    * Use of a trademark by a reseller of authentic goods or services.
    * Informational websites about goods or services represented by the trademark, such as product reviews.
    * Ordinary dictionary uses of a term.
    * Comparative advertising (with restrictions).
* Repeated use of trademark terms in a misleading way, including misleading ads created as a result of dynamic keyword insertion, may result in those trademark terms being blocked from use in your account.

**Ad and keyword investigations**

In addition to trademark infringement investigations, for the above markets, Microsoft will also investigate a complaint about trademark infringement in keyword use after it receives all required information via the [Intellectual Property Concern Form](https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/policies/intellectual-property-complaint-form). Advertisers may not bid on keywords, or use in the content of ads, any term whose use would infringe the trademark of any third party or otherwise be unlawful or in violation of the rights of any third party.

Use of a third-party trademark may be allowed if its use is truthful and lawful, for example, if:

* Your website provides information—product reviews, for example—about goods or services that are represented by the trademark, and your principal offering is not any product or service that competes with the goods or services represented by the trademark.
* You are clearly using the ordinary, dictionary use of a term, and your principal offering is not any product or service that competes with the goods or services represented by the trademark.
* You are a reseller whose website sells authentic goods or services that are distributed under the trademark.

All other markets should submit a complaint about the use of a trademark in ad copy via the [Intellectual Property Concern Form](https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/policies/intellectual-property-concern-forms).

Counterfeit policy
------------------

Microsoft prohibits the advertising of counterfeit goods. A counterfeit good is one that copies without permission the trademark and/or distinctive features of a product in order to misrepresent itself as the genuine product or promote a nearly identical replica or imitation of the original product. Trademark or designer product brand names cannot be modified with “counterfeit,” “fake,” "replica," "copy of," "inspired by," “bootleg” or any synonym thereof.

If you are a trademark owner and want to submit an allegation regarding the advertising of counterfeit goods, please complete the [Intellectual Property Concern Form](https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/policies/intellectual-property-complaint-form). Upon receiving a sufficiently detailed complaint containing all required information, Microsoft will investigate and, if appropriate, suspend the account in violation of this policy.

Intellectual property rights
----------------------------

* Ads may not infringe upon Intellectual Property (IP) rights of others. The use of logos, registered marks, copyrighted material etc., including use in images.
* Advertisers represent and warrant that they possess all the necessary rights and authorizations in order to promote movies, songs, media or any other content which may be subject to proprietary rights of others. Microsoft is not required to pre-validate or vet advertisements at any time, or to resolve disputes on behalf of its customers. At times however, Microsoft may ask you for additional information related to your advertisements.
* Advertisers are encouraged to maintain a DMCA compliant process, or local equivalent.
