10\. Trust & Safety
-------------------

In Short

We prioritize the safety of our community, which is why we have strict content guidelines in place. Among other measures, we verify models' identities, moderate messages, and investigate violations based on reports and our own efforts.

We care deeply about maintaining a healthy community at our Website. We have some of the most creative and expressive people and we want to create the safest environment for them where they can communicate and interact safely. That is why all content in any form possible must comply with all our Terms of Use, [Rules for Models](https://support.stripchat.com/hc/en-us/articles/4410728017553-Rules-for-Models), [Rules for Studios](https://support.stripchat.com/hc/en-us/articles/19410761348113-Studio-Rules) and [Community Guidelines](https://support.stripchat.com/hc/en-us/articles/4410728008977-Community-Guidelines).

We ensure the safety of all content through strong pre-moderation processes for unpublished content, proactive detection mechanisms as well through third party reporting systems for published content.

##### Types of Content

We strive to ensure that all content is harm-free. This includes but not limited to:

1. Text
2. Images
3. Videos
4. Live broadcasts

##### Our Definition of Harm

We consider content harmful if it harms the owner of the content, another person on or outside the website, or our Website overall. We consider any type of harm including but not limited to legal, physical, psychological, financial.

We use specific guidelines explained in this page to define our own perception of such harm.

##### Our Tools & Procedures

We employ multiple mechanisms in place that limit the possibility of harmful content reaching our Website (before publishing) as well as detect possibly harmful content after publishing.

Our Website over and above the requirements and standards set, only accepts content depicting persons registered and verified in its Website. Our Website does not rely on third parties to collect the consent of the persons depicted in the content available in its Website. By applying this rule, the Website aims to eliminate any possible distribution of non-consensual content through its website.

A dedicated in-house moderation team manually monitors and screens the content which has been submitted for publication to our Website on a 24/7 basis. The moderators follow the Website’s rules and guidelines to protect online users by keeping incompatible with the terms of use, illegal and inappropriate content off the site.

##### Verification System for Models

To fight fraud and ensure that all our models (Live broadcasters) can broadcast legally, they must be verified by our registration system first. We use both a third party KYC solution as well manual moderation to verify the legitimacy of all models and the documents they provide.

##### Pre-Recorded Content Moderation

We perform a pre-moderation of all the pre-recorded content including images and videos that our users and models upload, through both automated and human moderation, to ensure that the content is not illegal, violates third party industry standards, violates our internal rules and that the person depicted in it, consents to the distribution of the content, before such content is published on our Website. We refuse any content that we deem harmful as specified in our guidelines.

##### Suspicious Messages Pre-Moderation

We use an automated system to flag possible harmful messages to our team, in some cases if the system has sufficient reason to categorise a message as high risk, it will not be visible on our website until it is properly reviewed by a human Moderation Specialist.

##### Computer Vision Solutions

We use a Computer Vision (CV) solution that we trained to flag possibly harmful content to our moderation teams by deriving information from the live streams and sending notifications in real time. CV is also used to detect and verify the identity of the models that are broadcasting with their face hidden. Once the CV detects such a broadcast, our moderation team will receive a notification to investigate and confirm that the person who is broadcasting live at that time, is the same person that the identity was verified during the account opening procedure. If the model fails to verify her/his face during the given time window, the stream is automatically stopped until the verification is completed.

##### Third Party Reports

We also investigate all reports sent our way through our different reporting mechanisms available within the Website. We prioritise and handle reports based on the severity of violation reported.

##### Enforcing Our Guidelines

We enforce our guidelines consistently and fairly. Depending on the type of violation and how harmful it is, we apply different penalties. For a detailed understanding of our rules and the corresponding penalties, please see our [Rules & Penalties](https://support.stripchat.com/hc/en-us/articles/22536961950097-Rules-Penalties).

##### Judging ‘Harm’

We rely on a risk-based approach with the help of our guidelines specified in the previous section to judge whether a piece of content is harmful or not, as well as the severity of the harm. In the rare cases where we have sufficient reason to believe something is harmful even though it is not described in our guidelines, we will take actions against the content, inform its owner and will use the incident to better educate ourselves and improve our guidelines.

11\. Recommendation Systems
---------------------------

In Short

The website uses recommendation systems to suggest personalized content based on user preferences and interactions. Users in the European Economic Area (EEA) can disable certain recommendation systems, which may make their overall experience less optimal.

##### How recommendation systems work and why we recommend content

Our mission is to provide a safe, pleasurable, and engaging experience to all our users. To achieve this, we employ recommendation systems that personalize your experience. These systems suggest content based on your preferences and interactions with us.

During onboarding, you have the opportunity to select your interests, allowing us to personalize your experience. Furthermore, our recommendation systems take into account various factors such as your interactions and tokens spent on models and their content. This helps shape the recommendations you receive, ensuring that you are presented with content that aligns with your desires.

We use recommendation systems to analyze a user's past behavior, preferences, and interactions with models to personalize the content we suggest to them. By suggesting shows that align with the user's tastes and interests, we increase user satisfaction. In addition, with potentially many shows happening at any given moment, it's easy for users to miss content they would enjoy. Our recommendation systems help users discover new models and live streams that match their interests and that they might not find on their own.

##### Recommendation Systems used

Recommendation systems play a crucial role in providing personalized experiences for users. The different categories of recommendation systems are used in different sections to cater to specific user needs.

Below is the description of our recommendation systems and their functionalities:

General Sorting: General sorting refers to recommending content in all sections of the platform that are using recommendation systems except as otherwise mentioned in this document. The recommendations are influenced by various factors, including the popularity of a model, viewers' location, as well as the success of the show.

Viewer-Based Sorting: Viewer-based sorting is mostly influenced by the popularity of a specific broadcast and the viewers’ location. This recommendation system recommends content in all “Popular” sections of the platform.

My Favorites "Best Match": The "My Favorites'' section sorts models among others based on the chronological order in which a user adds models to the "My Favorites" list.

Recommended for You: The Recommended for You algorithm recommends content on the site in all “Recommended”-related sections. It is also used in the Feed section, recommending content that a user may find interesting. This recommendation system uses data related to user-model interaction, interest the user shows for the broadcast, and user preferences.

Country and Language Sections: Country and language sections are displayed based on users' geolocation-selected platform language and language preferences used on browsers.

Match Your Latest Picks: The “Match Your Latest Picks” algorithm uses real-time data related to positive user-model interaction, interest a user shows for broadcasts, and a user’s preferences. This recommendation system is used in the “Match Your Latest Picks” related sections.

For You: Sections are added to the “For You” section group for each user, based on user-model interaction, interest a user shows for the broadcast, and a user’s preferences, while also considering a user’s journey to model rooms.

Search: When a user types a word in the Search field, the system looks for words similar to what’s in the search field and finds a relevant category for the user.

Promos: Our “Promos” algorithm uses data related to user-model interaction, interest that a user shows for the show, a user’s preferences, and history with the platform, as well as location and platform settings. This recommendation system is used on promo campaigns.

Related Models: The “Related Models” section which can be found under the broadcast block of each model is not personalized for each user. This section generally sorts content depending on the success of the show, watch time, and the model a user is currently watching.

##### Ensuring your safety

Our recommendation systems prioritize safety and we take measures to remove content that is illegal and/or violates our guidelines. Our moderation team closely monitors content and therefore reduces the likelihood of recommending content that may not be suitable for users. For example, we strive to avoid or limit recommending certain categories of content that may not be suitable for a specific territory, even if that content is not completely removed.

##### Recommendation Systems with Optional Disable Feature for EEA Citizens

You have the ability to disable some of our recommendation systems. To do this, simply go down to our homepage and look for the disable option at the bottom of the left sidebar.

By disabling our recommendation systems, certain factors will no longer affect the content and models that are recommended to you. These factors include but not limited to:

1. Location and browser or website language
2. Information about your interaction with models.
3. Your journey to models' rooms

In other words, if you choose to disable our recommendation systems, your personalized experience will no longer be influenced by the factors mentioned above and your overall experience with our website will not be the best it can be.

However, please note that we will still sort content based on models' content, profiles, and success, as well as the popularity of their broadcasts. Additionally, your last-added Favorite models will continue to be displayed at the top, and the search function will still look for similar words to those in the search field. Sorting of content for all users who disabled this feature will be the same and it will not be based on profiling.

12\. Recordings
---------------

In Short

Models have the option to allow users to record their shows. Any recorded shows are for personal entertainment only. They are not for commercial or any other purpose.

Models have the option through the settings of their account to allow Users to record their shows. It is the responsibility of the Models to check whether that feature is enabled before each and every time they broadcast. By enabling that feature, Models consent to audio recording and video recording of their shows by Users and Stripchat.com and their release, publication, exhibition, or reproduction to be used for news, promotional purposes, advertising, inclusion on web sites, or for any other purpose(s) that Stripchat.com, its vendors, partners, affiliates and/or representatives deems fit to use. Models release Stripchat.com, its officers and employees, and each and all persons involved from any liability connected with the taking, recording, or publication of photographs, video and/or or sound recordings.

By enabling this setting, Models waives all rights they may have to any claims for payment or royalties (excluding the token amount that the Users will pay for the recording, if any) in connection with any exhibition, streaming, or other publication of these materials, regardless of the purpose or sponsoring of such exhibiting, broadcasting or other publication irrespective of whether a fee for admission is charged. Models also waive any right to inspect or approve any photo, video, or audio recording taken by Stripchat.com or the User.

Users may record Model’s show for personal use only. Any recorded shows cannot be used for commercial or any other purpose. The release, publication, exhibition, or reproduction of the recorded shows by the Users is strictly prohibited.

In the event that any recorded shows/videos/photos, either public or private, are purchased by a User, such content remains in the possession of and/or available to the User even if the Model's account is permanently deleted.
